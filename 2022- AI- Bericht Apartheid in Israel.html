<a name=11></a><b>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY &#160;</b><br/>
<b>“Israel is not a state of all its citizens… [but rather] the&#160;<br/>nation-state of the Jewish people and only them”&#160;<br/></b>Message posted online in March 2019 by Israel’s then prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu<br/>
On 18 May 2021, Palestinians across cities and villages in Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip closed their offices, shops, restaurants and schools, abandoned&#160;construction sites, and refused&#160;<br/>to report to work for the whole day. In a display of unity not seen for&#160;decades, they defied the territorial&#160;<br/>fragmentation and segregation they face in their daily lives and observed a general strike to protest their&#160;<br/>shared repression by Israel.&#160;<br/>
The strike was sparked by the Israeli authorities’ plan to evict seven Palestinian families from their homes in&#160;<br/>Sheikh Jarrah, a Palestinian residential neighbourhood near the Old City in East Jerusalem, which has been&#160;<br/>repeatedly targeted by Israel’s sustained campaign to expand illegal settlements and transfer Jewish settlers.&#160;<br/>To stop the threatened evictions, the Palestinian families launched a campaign on social media under the&#160;<br/>hashtag #SaveSheikhJarrah attracting worldwide attention and mobilizing protesters on the ground. Israeli&#160;<br/>security forces responded to the protests with the same excessive force they have been using to stifle&#160;<br/>Palestinian dissent for decades. They arbitrarily arrested peaceful demonstrators, threw sound and stun&#160;<br/>grenades at crowds, dispersed them with excessive force and skunk&#160;water, and fired concussion grenades at&#160;<br/>worshippers and protesters gathered in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound.&#160;<br/>
The brutal repression generated a wave of solidarity elsewhere in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT)&#160;<br/>and amongst Palestinian citizens of Israel, across the Green Line (the demarcation line set out in the 1949&#160;<br/>Armistice Agreements between Israel and its neighbours that served as the de facto borders of the State&#160;<br/>of Israel until 1967). In Israel, police forces orchestrated a discriminatory campaign against Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizens involving mass arbitrary arrests of, and unlawful force against, peaceful protesters, while failing to&#160;<br/>protect Palestinians from organized assaults by Jewish attackers following the outbreak of intercommunal&#160;<br/>violence. Meanwhile, armed hostilities broke out on 10 May as Palestinian armed groups fired indiscriminate&#160;<br/>rockets into Israel from Gaza. Israel responded with a ruthless 11-day military offensive against the territory,&#160;<br/>targeting residential homes without effective advance warning, damaging essential infrastructure, displacing&#160;<br/>tens of thousands of people and killing and injuring hundreds of others. It thereby exacerbated the chronic&#160;<br/>humanitarian crisis caused primarily by Israel’s long-standing unlawful blockade.&#160;<br/>
For many Palestinians who observed the general strike in Israel and the OPT, these discriminatory and&#160;<br/>repressive actions in East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and Palestinian cities and towns, as well as “mixed&#160;<br/>cities” with Jewish and Palestinian populations, in Israel represented different manifestations of an overall&#160;<br/>system of oppression and domination by Israel. This system, which operates with varying levels of intensity&#160;<br/>and repression based on Palestinians’ status in the separate enclaves where Palestinians live today, and&#160;<br/>violates their rights in different ways, ultimately seeks to establish and maintain Jewish hegemony wherever&#160;<br/>

<a name=12></a>Israel exercises effective control. By coming out to protest, they were expressing unity, and a rejection of&#160;<br/>Israel’s fragmentation of the Palestinian people. A manifesto published on social media by some activists&#160;<br/>that same day denounced long-standing Israeli practices and policies that “tried to turn [Palestinians] into&#160;<br/>different societies, each living apart, each in its own separate prison”.<br/>
Palestinians have been calling for an understanding of Israel’s rule as apartheid for over two decades&#160;<br/>and have been at the forefront of advocacy in that regard at the UN. Over time, research conducted&#160;<br/>by Palestinian human rights organizations, and more recently some Israeli human rights groups, has&#160;<br/>contributed to broader international recognition of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid. Yet states,&#160;<br/>particularly Israel’s Western allies, have been reluctant to heed these calls, and have refused to take any&#160;<br/>meaningful action against Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinian organizations and human rights defenders who&#160;<br/>have been leading anti-apartheid advocacy and campaigning efforts have faced growing Israeli repression&#160;<br/>for years as punishment for their work. In October 2021, the Israeli authorities escalated their attacks&#160;<br/>on Palestinian civil society even further by misusing counterterrorism legislation to outlaw six prominent&#160;<br/>organizations, including three major human rights groups, to shut down&#160;their offices and to detain and&#160;<br/>prosecute their employees. In parallel, Israel has subjected Israeli organizations denouncing apartheid and&#160;<br/>other serious human rights violations against Palestinians to smears and delegitimization campaigns.<br/>
Building on a growing body of work, Amnesty International has documented and analysed Israel’s&#160;<br/>institutionalized and systematic discrimination against Palestinians within the framework of the definition&#160;<br/>of apartheid under international law. This has aimed to determine whether discriminatory and exclusionary&#160;<br/>Israeli laws, policies and practices against Palestinians amount to apartheid as a violation of public&#160;<br/>international law, a serious human rights violation and a crime against humanity. It has done so by firstly&#160;<br/>determining Israel’s intent to oppress and dominate all Palestinians by establishing its hegemony across&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT, including through means of demography, and maximizing resources for the benefit of its&#160;<br/>Jewish population at the expense of Palestinians. It has then analysed the laws, policies and practices which&#160;<br/>have, over time, come to constitute the main tools for establishing and maintaining this system, and which&#160;<br/>discriminate against and segregate Palestinians in Israel and the OPT today, as well as controlling Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees’ right to return. It has conducted this analysis by examining the key components of this system of&#160;<br/>oppression and domination: territorial fragmentation; segregation and control through the denial of equal&#160;<br/>nationality and status, restrictions on movement, discriminatory family&#160;reunification laws, the use of military&#160;<br/>rule and restrictions on the right to political participation and popular resistance; dispossession of land&#160;<br/>and property; and the suppression of Palestinians’ human development and denial of their economic and&#160;<br/>social rights. Furthermore, it has documented specific inhuman and&#160;inhumane acts, serious human rights&#160;<br/>violations and crimes under international law, committed against the Palestinian population with the intent to&#160;<br/>maintain this system of oppression and domination. &#160;<br/>
In this way, Amnesty International has demonstrated that Israel has imposed a system of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination over Palestinians wherever it exercises control over the enjoyment of their rights – across Israel&#160;<br/>and the OPT and with regard to Palestinian refugees. The segregation is conducted in a systematic and&#160;<br/>highly institutionalized manner through laws, policies and practices, all intended to prevent Palestinians&#160;<br/>from claiming and enjoying equal rights to Jewish Israelis within Israel and the OPT, and thus intended to&#160;<br/>oppress and dominate the Palestinian people. This oppression and domination have been cemented by a&#160;<br/>legal regime that controls (by negating) the rights of Palestinian refugees residing outside Israel and the OPT&#160;<br/>to return to their homes. Over decades, Israeli demographic and geopolitical considerations have shaped&#160;<br/>policies towards Palestinians in each of the different areas of Israel, East Jerusalem, the rest of the West&#160;<br/>Bank and the Gaza Strip in different ways. This means that, today, Israel’s system of control is not applied&#160;<br/>uniformly across all areas. Palestinians experience this system in different ways and face differing levels of&#160;<br/>repression based on their status and the area in which they live.<br/>
The organization has concluded that Israel has perpetrated the international wrong of apartheid, as a human&#160;<br/>rights violation and a violation of public international law wherever it imposes this system. It has assessed&#160;<br/>that almost all of Israel’s civilian administration and military authorities, as well as governmental and quasi-<br/>governmental institutions, are involved in the enforcement of the system of apartheid against Palestinians&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=13></a>across Israel and the OPT and against Palestinian refugees and their descendants outside the territory.&#160;<br/>Amnesty International has also concluded that the patterns of proscribed acts perpetuated by Israel both&#160;<br/>inside Israel and in the OPT form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the&#160;<br/>Palestinian population, and that the inhuman or inhumane acts committed within the context of this attack&#160;<br/>have been committed with the intention to maintain this system and amount to the crime against humanity&#160;<br/>of apartheid under both the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute.&#160;<br/>
This work builds on decades of Amnesty International desk and field&#160;research collecting evidence of&#160;<br/>violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Israel and the OPT, and on publications by&#160;<br/>Palestinian, Israeli and international organizations in addition to academic studies, monitoring by grassroots&#160;<br/>activist groups, reports by UN agencies, experts and human rights bodies, and media articles.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International carried out research and analysis in the course of this work between July 2017 and&#160;<br/>November 2021. Researchers extensively analysed relevant Israeli legislation, regulations, military orders,&#160;<br/>directives by government institutions and statements by Israeli government and military officials. The&#160;<br/>organization reviewed other Israeli government documents, such as planning and zoning documents and&#160;<br/>plans, budgets and statistics, Israeli parliamentary archives and Israeli court judgments. It also examined&#160;<br/>relevant reports and statistics published by Palestinian authorities. The research was guided by a global&#160;<br/>policy on the human rights violation and crime of apartheid adopted by Amnesty International in July&#160;<br/>2017, following recognition that the organization had given insufficient attention to situations of systematic&#160;<br/>discrimination and oppression around the world.<br/>
As part of its research, Amnesty International spoke with representatives of Palestinian, Israeli and&#160;<br/>international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), relevant UN agencies, legal practitioners, scholars and&#160;<br/>academics, journalists, and other relevant stakeholders. In addition, it conducted extensive legal analysis on&#160;<br/>the situation, including engaging with and seeking advice from external experts on international law.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International’s work on this issue aims to support Palestinian civil society and Israeli organizations&#160;<br/>in their efforts to end Israel’s oppression and domination over Palestinians at a time when their work is&#160;<br/>becoming increasingly threatened. By doing so, it also hopes to contribute to a greater understanding and&#160;<br/>recognition of institutionalized discrimination committed in Israel and the OPT and against Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees as a system and crime of apartheid.<br/>
<b>APARTHEID IN INTERNATIONAL LAW<br/></b>Apartheid is a violation of public international law, a grave violation of internationally protected human rights&#160;<br/>and a crime against humanity under international criminal law. Three main international treaties prohibit&#160;<br/>and/or explicitly criminalize apartheid: the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial&#160;<br/>Discrimination (ICERD), the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of&#160;<br/>Apartheid (Apartheid Convention) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute).<br/>
The crime against humanity of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention, the Rome Statute and customary&#160;<br/>international law is committed when any inhuman or inhumane act (essentially a serious human rights&#160;<br/>violation) is perpetrated in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination&#160;<br/>by one racial group over another, with the intention to maintain that system. A regime of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination can best be understood as the systematic, prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment by one&#160;<br/>racial group of members of another with the intention to control the second racial group.&#160;<br/>
Thus, the crime against humanity of apartheid is committed when serious human rights violations are&#160;<br/>committed in the context, and with the specific intent, of maintaining&#160;a regime or system of prolonged and&#160;<br/>cruel discriminatory control of one or more racial groups by another.&#160;<br/>
The framework of apartheid allows a comprehensive understanding, grounded in international law, of a&#160;<br/>situation of segregation, oppression and domination by one racial group over another. Amnesty International&#160;<br/>notes and clarifies that systems of oppression and domination will never be identical. Therefore, it does not&#160;<br/>

<a name=14></a>seek to argue that, or assess whether, any system of oppression and domination as perpetrated in Israel and&#160;<br/>the OPT is, for instance, the same or analogous to the system of segregation, oppression and domination as&#160;<br/>perpetrated in South Africa between 1948 and 1994.<br/>
To determine whether Israel has created and maintained an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression&#160;<br/>and domination, Amnesty International looked at the way Israel exerts control over the Palestinian people.&#160;<br/>It also considered a number of serious human rights violations that would constitute the crime against&#160;<br/>humanity of apartheid if committed with the intention to maintain such a system of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination.<br/>
<b>INTENT TO OPPRESS AND DOMINATE PALESTINIANS&#160;<br/></b>Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued an explicit policy of establishing and maintaining&#160;<br/>a Jewish demographic hegemony and maximizing its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis while&#160;<br/>minimizing the number of Palestinians and restricting their rights and obstructing their ability to challenge&#160;<br/>this dispossession. In 1967, Israel extended this policy beyond the Green Line to the West Bank and Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip, which it has occupied ever since. Today, all territories controlled by Israel continue to be administered&#160;<br/>with the purpose of benefiting Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians, while Palestinian refugees&#160;<br/>continue to be excluded.&#160;<br/>
Demographic considerations have from the outset guided Israeli legislation and policymaking. The&#160;<br/>demography of the newly created state was to be changed to the benefit of Jewish Israelis, while Palestinians&#160;<br/>– whether inside Israel or, later on, in the OPT – were perceived as a threat to establishing and maintaining&#160;<br/>a Jewish majority, and as a result were to be expelled, fragmented, segregated, controlled, dispossessed of&#160;<br/>their land and property and deprived of their economic and social rights.&#160;<br/>
Jewish Israelis form a group that is unified by a privileged legal status embedded in Israeli law, which&#160;<br/>extends to them through state services and protections regardless of where they reside in the territories&#160;<br/>under Israel’s effective control. The Jewish identity of the State of Israel has been established in its laws and&#160;<br/>the practice of its official and national institutions. Israeli laws perceive and treat Jewish identity, depending&#160;<br/>on the context, as a religious, descent-based, and/or national or ethnic identity.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians are treated by the Israeli state differently based on its consideration of them as having a&#160;<br/>racialized non-Jewish, Arab status and, beyond that, as being part of a group with particular attributes that&#160;<br/>is different from other non-Jewish groups. With respect to Palestinian citizens of Israel, the Israeli Ministry&#160;<br/>of Foreign Affairs officially classifies them as “Arab citizens of Israel”,&#160;an inclusive term that describes&#160;<br/>a number of different and primarily Arabic-speaking groups, including Muslim Arabs (this classification&#160;<br/>includes Bedouins), Christian Arabs, Druze and Circassians. However, in public discourse, Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>and media generally refer only to Muslim Arabs and Christian Arabs – those who generally self-identify as&#160;<br/>Palestinians – as Israeli Arabs and associate them with Palestinians living in the OPT and beyond, using the&#160;<br/>specific terms Druze and Circassians for those other non-Jewish groups. The authorities also clearly consider&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel as a single group different from Druze and Circassians since they exempt this&#160;<br/>group alone from military service in “consideration for their family, religious, and cultural affiliations with the&#160;<br/>Arab world (which has subjected Israel to frequent attacks), as well as concern over possible dual loyalties.”&#160;<br/>
In May 1948, the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel announced a Jewish state. Although&#160;<br/>it guaranteed the right to “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants”, the right has&#160;<br/>not been guaranteed in the Basic Laws, which act as constitutional documents in the absence of a written&#160;<br/>constitution.&#160;<br/>
At the same time as establishing Israel as a Jewish state, the 1948 Declaration appealed to Jewish people&#160;<br/>around the world to immigrate to Israel. In 1950, Israel granted every Jew the right to immigrate to Israel&#160;<br/>under the Law of Return, followed by the right to automatic Israeli citizenship under the Nationality Law&#160;<br/>of 1952. The Israeli authorities saw this partly as a necessary measure to prevent another attempt to&#160;<br/>

<a name=15></a>exterminate Jews in the wake of the Holocaust and to provide shelter to Jews who faced persecution&#160;<br/>elsewhere in the world. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced during the&#160;<br/>1947-49 conflict remained barred from returning to their homes based on demographic considerations.&#160;<br/>The essence of the system of oppression and domination over Palestinians was clearly crystallized in the&#160;<br/>2018 nation state law, which enshrined the principle that the “State of Israel is the nation State of the Jewish&#160;<br/>people” and that the right of self-determination is exclusive “to the Jewish people”.<br/>
In parallel, statements by leading Israeli politicians as well as senior civilian and military officials over the&#160;<br/>years confirm Israel’s intention to maintain a Jewish demographic majority and to oppress and dominate&#160;<br/>Palestinians. Since 1948, regardless of their political affiliations, they&#160;have publicly emphasized the&#160;<br/>overarching objective of maintaining Israel’s identity as a Jewish state, and stated their intention to minimize&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ access to and control of land across all territories under Israel’s effective control. They have&#160;<br/>carried this out by seizing Palestinians’ homes and properties and effectively restricting them to living in&#160;<br/>enclaves through discriminatory planning and housing policies. The discriminatory intent to dominate&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens in Israel is also manifested through statements that clearly point to the need for a&#160;<br/>separate and unequal citizenship structure and the denial of Palestinians’ right to family reunification as a&#160;<br/>means of controlling demography.&#160;<br/>
The intention to dominate and control the Palestinian population in the OPT through discriminatory land,&#160;<br/>planning and housing policies as well as the denial of any agricultural or industrial development for the&#160;<br/>benefit of Palestinians is equally clear. Since the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem, Israeli governments&#160;<br/>have set targets for the demographic ratio of Jews to Palestinians in Jerusalem as a whole and have made&#160;<br/>it clear through public statements that the denial of economic and social rights to Palestinians in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem is an intentional policy to coerce them into leaving the city. Israel’s withdrawal of its settlers from&#160;<br/>Gaza, while it maintained control over the people in the territory in other ways, was also expressly linked&#160;<br/>to demographic questions, and a realization that a Jewish majority could not be achieved there. Finally,&#160;<br/>public materials published by the Israeli government make it obvious that Israel’s long-standing policy to&#160;<br/>deprive millions of Palestinian refugees of their right to return to their homes is also guided by demographic&#160;<br/>considerations.&#160;<br/>
<b>TERRITORIAL FRAGMENTATION AND LEGAL&#160;</b><br/>
<b>SEGREGATION<br/></b>In the course of establishing Israel as a Jewish state in 1948, its leaders were responsible for the mass&#160;<br/>expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages in&#160;<br/>what amounted to ethnic cleansing. They chose to coerce Palestinians into enclaves within the State of Israel&#160;<br/>and, following their military occupation in 1967, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They have appropriated the&#160;<br/>vast majority of Palestinians’ land and natural resources. They have introduced laws, policies and practices&#160;<br/>that&#160;systematically&#160;and cruelly&#160;discriminate&#160;against&#160;Palestinians,&#160;leaving&#160;them&#160;fragmented geographically&#160;and&#160;<br/>politically, in a constant state of fear and insecurity, and often impoverished.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, Israel’s leaders have opted to systemically privilege Jewish citizens in law and in practice through&#160;<br/>the distribution of land and resources, resulting in their relative wealth and well-being at the expense of&#160;<br/>Palestinians. They have steadily expanded Jewish settlements on occupied Palestinian territory in violation of&#160;<br/>international law.&#160;<br/>
In 1948, before Israel was established, Palestinians comprised around 70% of the population of Palestine&#160;<br/>(then a British mandate territory) and owned about 90% of the privately owned land. Jews, many of whom&#160;<br/>had emigrated from Europe, comprised around 30% of the population and they and Jewish institutions&#160;<br/>owned about 6.5% of the land.&#160;<br/>
Israeli authorities have acted to turn that situation on its head. Some&#160;of those who fled their homes during&#160;<br/>the 1947-49 conflict were internally displaced from their villages, towns&#160;and cities to other parts of what&#160;<br/>

<a name=16></a>became Israel. Others fled to different parts of what was then British&#160;mandate Palestine (22% of which fell&#160;<br/>under the control of Jordan and Egypt following the conflict – what is now the OPT). Most of the rest fled to&#160;<br/>the neighbouring Arab countries of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel prevents these Palestinian refugees,&#160;<br/>and their descendants, as well as internally displaced persons within Israel, from returning to their former&#160;<br/>places of residence.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians became fragmented even further after the June 1967 war, which resulted in Israel’s military&#160;<br/>occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, the creation of a separate legal&#160;<br/>and administrative regime to control the occupied territories, and another wave of Palestinian displacement.&#160;<br/>
The new military regime in the OPT was established on top of a pre-existing multi-layered legal system made&#160;<br/>up of Ottoman, British, Jordanian and Egyptian laws – the legacy of the powers that had previously controlled&#160;<br/>the area.&#160;<br/>
In 1994, the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) created the&#160;<br/>Palestinian Authority and granted it limited control over Palestinian civil affairs in urban centres. In addition&#160;<br/>to failing to end the occupation, the Oslo Accords divided the West Bank into three different administrative&#160;<br/>areas, with varying levels of Palestinian and Israeli military and civil jurisdiction, fragmenting and segregating&#160;<br/>Palestinians even further to Israel’s benefit. Even though Israel withdrew Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip&#160;<br/>in 2005, it retained effective control over the territory, which it tightened further through an unlawful air, sea&#160;<br/>and land blockade, and an official policy separating Gaza from the West Bank, following Hamas’s takeover&#160;<br/>of the territory two years later. As a result, the entirety of the West Bank and Gaza Strip remains under Israeli&#160;<br/>military occupation, with Israel controlling the Palestinian population living there, their natural resources&#160;<br/>and, with the exception of Gaza’s short southern border with Egypt, their land and sea borders and airspace.&#160;<br/>Two sets of complementary international legal frameworks continue to apply to the conduct of Israel as&#160;<br/>the occupying power with effective control over the OPT: international human rights law and international&#160;<br/>humanitarian law.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians in the OPT living under these separate jurisdictions require permits from the Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>to cross between them – from and to the Gaza Strip, annexed East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank&#160;<br/>– and are also separated from Palestinian citizens of Israel, both geographically and on the basis of their&#160;<br/>status. Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees displaced during the 1947-49 and 1967 conflicts continue to be&#160;<br/>physically isolated from those residing in Israel and the OPT through Israel’s continuous denial of their right&#160;<br/>to return to their homes, towns and villages.<br/>
Palestinian citizens of Israel are subject to Israeli civil laws, which in general afford them greater freedoms&#160;<br/>and human rights protections than Palestinians living in the OPT, but nonetheless deny them equal rights&#160;<br/>with Jewish Israelis (including to political participation) and institutionalize discrimination against them.&#160;<br/>While Palestinians in annexed East Jerusalem also live under Israeli civil laws, they are granted permanent&#160;<br/>residence rather than citizenship. On the other hand, Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank remain&#160;<br/>subject to Israel’s military rule and draconian military orders adopted since 1967. The vast majority of these&#160;<br/>orders no longer apply to the Gaza Strip after Israel removed most aspects of its military rule there with&#160;<br/>the withdrawal of settlers in 2005. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are additionally subject to&#160;<br/>Palestinian laws.<br/>
Today, Palestinian citizens and permanent residents of Israel comprise some 21% of Israel’s population&#160;<br/>and number approximately 1.9 million. Some 90% of Palestinians with Israeli citizenship live in 139 densely&#160;<br/>populated towns and villages in the Galilee and Triangle regions in northern Israel and the Negev/Naqab&#160;<br/>region in the south, as a result of deliberate segregation policies. The vast majority of the remaining 10% live&#160;<br/>in “mixed cities”.<br/>
As of July 2021, there were 358,800 Palestinian residents within the boundaries of the Jerusalem&#160;<br/>Municipality, comprising 38% of the city’s population. Of these, around 150,000 live in areas segregated&#160;<br/>from the rest of the city by the fence/wall and other military checkpoints. Some 225,178 Jewish Israeli&#160;<br/>settlers were also living in East Jerusalem in 13 illegal settlements built by the Israeli authorities and in&#160;<br/>private homes taken over from Palestinians under discriminatory schemes.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=17></a>Approximately 3 million Palestinians live in the rest of the West Bank in addition to more than 441,600&#160;<br/>Jewish settlers residing in 132 settlements that have been officially established by the Israeli government, as&#160;<br/>well as 140 unauthorized outposts that have been established since the 1990s without government approval&#160;<br/>and are considered illegal even under Israeli law. Some 2 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip. Of&#160;<br/>these, around 1.4 million (over 70% of the population) are registered refugees with the UN Relief and Works&#160;<br/>Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).<br/>
<b>LEGAL SEGREGATION AND CONTROL<br/></b>Israel’s rule over the OPT through military orders in the context of its occupation has given rise to a false&#160;<br/>perception that the military regime in the OPT is separate from the civil system in annexed East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>and within Israel. This view ignores the fact that many elements of Israel’s repressive military system&#160;<br/>in the OPT originate in Israel’s 18-year-long military rule over Palestinian citizens of Israel, and that the&#160;<br/>dispossession of Palestinians in Israel continues today.&#160;<br/>
The very existence of these separate legal regimes, however, is one of the main tools through which Israel&#160;<br/>fragments Palestinians and enforces its system of oppression and domination, and serves, as noted by the&#160;<br/>UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), “to obscure [the Israeli apartheid] regime’s&#160;<br/>very existence”. Indeed, Israeli policies aim to fragment Palestinians into different geographic and legal&#160;<br/>domains of control not only to treat them differently, or to segregate them, from the Jewish population, but&#160;<br/>also to treat them differently from each other in order to weaken ties between Palestinian communities, to&#160;<br/>suppress any form of sustained dissent against the system they have created, and ensure more effective&#160;<br/>political and security control over land and people across all territories.&#160;<br/>
<b>USE OF MILITARY RULE TO CONTROL AND DISPOSSESS<br/></b>Over the years, Israel has used military rule as a key tool to establish its system of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination over Palestinians across both sides of the Green Line, applying it over different groups of&#160;<br/>Palestinians in Israel and the OPT almost continuously since 1948 – with the exception of a seven-month&#160;<br/>gap in 1967 – to advance Jewish settlement in areas of strategic importance and to dispossess Palestinians&#160;<br/>of their land and property under the guise of maintaining security.&#160;<br/>
Israel placed its Palestinian citizens under military rule for the first 18 years of its existence (1948-1966) and&#160;<br/>used during that time British Mandate Defence (Emergency) Regulations that granted them unrestricted&#160;<br/>powers to control the movement of Palestinian residents, confiscate&#160;their property, allow for the closure of&#160;<br/>entire villages as military zones, demolish their houses, and try them before military courts. Palestinians&#160;<br/>required permits to leave their areas of residence, including to access medical care and jobs. Israeli state&#160;<br/>institutions placed Palestinians under a system of surveillance and control that deliberately restricted their&#160;<br/>political freedoms by banning protests and arresting political activists on account of their political activities.&#160;<br/>
Israel eventually abolished its military rule over Palestinian citizens in December 1966 after it successfully&#160;<br/>prevented internally displaced Palestinians from returning to their homes in empty villages by destroying&#160;<br/>them and subjecting their land to forestation. While restrictions on movement were progressively removed,&#160;<br/>and the human rights situation of Palestinian citizens of Israel has undoubtedly greatly improved since the&#160;<br/>end of the military rule over them, elements of the system remained. The emergency regulations were never&#160;<br/>repealed and as of 1967, their application was extended to the occupied West Bank (excluding annexed East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem) and Gaza Strip to control the Palestinian population there, prevent any form of dissent, and allow&#160;<br/>the Israeli state to dispossess Palestinians of their land and resources. Beyond legislation, the experience&#160;<br/>accumulated by the Israeli authorities, during the military rule over Palestinian citizens of Israel constituted&#160;<br/>the basis for the military administration in the OPT.&#160;<br/>
Despite the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, more than 1,800 Israeli military orders continue&#160;<br/>to control and restrict all aspects of the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank: their livelihoods, status,&#160;<br/>movement, political activism, detention and prosecution, and access to natural resources.

<a name=18></a>legislation in the West Bank is enforced by the military justice system. Since 1967, the Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>have arrested over 800,000 Palestinian men, women and children in the West Bank, including East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, bringing many of them before military courts that systematically fail to meet&#160;<br/>international standards of fair trial, and where the vast majority of cases end in conviction.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians from the Gaza Strip were subjected to Israeli military legislation and tried before military courts&#160;<br/>until Israel dismantled its settlements in 2005. Since then, elements of Israeli military law have continued to&#160;<br/>apply to the area with regards to the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, access to territorial&#160;<br/>waters and the “buffer zone” along the fence separating Israel from Gaza.&#160;<br/>
By contrast, Jewish settlers have been exempted from the military orders governing Palestinians since the&#160;<br/>late 1970s after Israel extraterritorially extended its civil law over Israeli citizens residing in or travelling&#160;<br/>through the OPT. Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank are therefore brought before Israeli civilian&#160;<br/>courts.<br/>
<b>DENIAL OF NATIONALITY, RESIDENCE AND FAMILY LIFE<br/></b>Israel maintains its system of fragmentation and segregation through different legal regimes that ensure&#160;<br/>the denial of nationality and status to Palestinians, violate their right&#160;to family unification and return to their&#160;<br/>country and their homes, and severely restrict freedom of movement based on legal status. All are intended&#160;<br/>to control the Palestinian population and aim to preserve a Jewish Israeli majority in key areas across Israel&#160;<br/>and the OPT.<br/>
Whilst they are granted citizenship, Palestinian citizens of Israel are denied a nationality, establishing a legal&#160;<br/>differentiation from Jewish Israelis. They are also denied certain benefits because of a linked exemption from&#160;<br/>military service.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens. Instead, they are granted fragile&#160;<br/>permanent residency status that allows them to reside and work in the city, and enjoy social benefits&#160;<br/>provided by the Israeli National Insurance Institute and the national health insurance. Under discriminatory&#160;<br/>legislation and policies, however, the Israeli authorities have revoked the status of thousands of Palestinians,&#160;<br/>including retroactively, if they cannot prove that Jerusalem is their “centre of life”. This has had devastating&#160;<br/>consequences on their human rights. By contrast, Jewish Israeli settlers residing in East Jerusalem enjoy&#160;<br/>Israeli citizenship and are exempt from laws and measures enacted against Palestinian residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>
At the same time, Israel has controlled the population registry in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 and&#160;<br/>imposed policies, restrictions and measures to control the demography of the territory. Palestinians in these&#160;<br/>territories remain without citizenship and are considered stateless, except for those who have obtained a&#160;<br/>citizenship from a third country. The Israeli military issues them with&#160;identification cards that enable them to&#160;<br/>permanently live and work in the territory. Israel’s control of the population registry since 1967 has further&#160;<br/>facilitated the fragmentation of Palestinians and restricted their freedom of movement based on their legal&#160;<br/>status and residence.<br/>
After the outbreak of the Palestinian&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;(uprising) at the end of 2000, the Israeli Civil Administration,&#160;<br/>a military unit that oversees all civilian matters for Jewish Israeli settlers and Palestinian residents in the&#160;<br/>West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, froze most changes to the Palestinian population registry without&#160;<br/>prior notification to the Palestinian Authority. The freeze included the&#160;suspension of all “family unification”&#160;<br/>procedures for Palestinian residents of the OPT who had married foreign nationals. Even though on two&#160;<br/>occasions since then Israel committed to granting a small number of&#160;family reunification requests as goodwill&#160;<br/>diplomatic gestures to the Ramallah-based Palestinian authorities, in general, Israel continues to deny the&#160;<br/>conferring of residency status to tens of thousands of foreign nationals who are married to Palestinians from&#160;<br/>the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This is profoundly discriminatory; Jewish settlers residing in settlements in&#160;<br/>the West Bank face no restrictions in obtaining authorization from the Israeli authorities for their spouses to&#160;<br/>enter the occupied territory and reside with them.<br/>

<a name=19></a>In early 2003, Israel began prohibiting Palestinians registered in Gaza from residing in the West Bank,&#160;<br/>arresting thousands and removing them forcibly to the Gaza Strip after labelling them as “infiltrators”. Over&#160;<br/>the years, the Israeli authorities authorized some Palestinians to change their addresses from the Gaza Strip to&#160;<br/>the West Bank but only implemented their commitment partially. At the same time, thousands of Palestinians&#160;<br/>remain undocumented in Gaza as the Israeli authorities have refused to regularize their status since 2008.&#160;<br/>
These policies have serious consequences on the ability of Palestinians in the OPT to lead a normal life,&#160;<br/>particularly in light of stringent restrictions on movement: those in the West Bank who are not registered face&#160;<br/>the imminent threat of deportation, are unable to access healthcare, education and social benefits, open a&#160;<br/>bank account and have legal jobs, and are effectively prisoners in their homes because of fear of ID checks&#160;<br/>at Israeli checkpoints. Undocumented Palestinians in Gaza are also denied their freedom of movement,&#160;<br/>and access to healthcare and education in other parts of the OPT and abroad. Overall, restrictions on family&#160;<br/>unification interfere with Palestinians’ enjoyment of their rights to privacy, to family life and to marry, blocking&#160;<br/>them from conferring residency status to their spouses and children.&#160;<br/>
Israel continues to deny Palestinian refugees – displaced in the 1947-49 and 1967 conflicts – and their&#160;<br/>descendants their right to gain Israeli citizenship or residency status in Israel or the OPT. By doing so, it&#160;<br/>denies them their right to return to their former places of residence and property – a right, which has been&#160;<br/>widely recognized under international human rights law.<br/>
<b>DISRUPTION OF FAMILY LIFE&#160;<br/></b>In addition to measures that separate families inside the OPT, Israel has enacted discriminatory laws&#160;<br/>and policies that disrupt family life for Palestinians across the Green Line in a clear example of how&#160;<br/>Israel fragments and segregates Palestinians through one system of domination. Like other measures&#160;<br/>Amnesty International has documented, they are primarily guided by demographic – rather than security –&#160;<br/>considerations and aim to minimize Palestinian presence inside the Green Line to maintain a Jewish majority.<br/>
Since 2002, Israel has adopted a policy of prohibiting Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza from&#160;<br/>gaining status in Israel or East Jerusalem through marriage, thus preventing family unification. The&#160;<br/>Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law enshrined the policy in law between 2003 and its expiry in July 2021.&#160;<br/>The law barred thousands of Palestinians in Israel and East Jerusalem from living there with their Palestinian&#160;<br/>spouses from the West Bank and Gaza. Israel’s then interior minister stated the law was needed because “it&#160;<br/>was felt that [family unification] would be exploited to achieve a creeping right of return…”<br/>
The 2003 law did not allow spouses from the West Bank or Gaza to receive permanent residency or Israeli&#160;<br/>citizenship. Instead, successful applicants received temporary, six-month permits. Amendments to the law over&#160;<br/>the years broadened its scope to further limit and deny family reunification for Palestinian citizens of Israel.&#160;<br/>
When the Israeli government lost the vote to extend the law in July 2021, it signalled its intent to nonetheless&#160;<br/>maintain the policy. The interior minister issued instructions not to accept applications from Palestinians for&#160;<br/>family unification until new or similar legislation is put in place. Israeli&#160;authorities say the policy is necessary&#160;<br/>on “security grounds”, but it is implemented in a blanket manner without specific evidence against individuals.&#160;<br/>
By contrast, the 2003 law explicitly did not apply to residents of Jewish settlements in the West Bank wanting&#160;<br/>to marry and live with their spouse inside Israel, making it, and the ongoing policy underpinning it, blatantly&#160;<br/>discriminatory.&#160;<br/>
<b>RESTRICTIONS ON MOVEMENT &#160;<br/></b>Since the mid-1990s the Israeli authorities have imposed a closure system within the OPT and between&#160;<br/>the OPT and Israel, gradually subjecting millions of Palestinians who live in the West Bank, including East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip to ever more stringent restrictions on movement based on their legal status. These&#160;<br/>restrictions are another tool through which Israel segregates Palestinians into separate enclaves, isolates&#160;<br/>them from each other and the world, and ultimately enforces its domination.<br/>

<a name=20></a>Israel controls all entry and exit points in the West Bank and controls all travel between the West Bank and&#160;<br/>abroad. Israel also controls all movement of people into and out of the Gaza Strip to the rest of the OPT and&#160;<br/>Israel through the Erez Crossing, the passenger crossing from Gaza to Israel. (The Egyptian authorities also&#160;<br/>maintain tight Egyptian restrictions on the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.) With the exception&#160;<br/>of East Jerusalemites, who have a permanent residency status in Israel, Palestinians from the OPT&#160;<br/>cannot travel abroad via Israeli airports unless they obtain a special permit, which is issued only to senior&#160;<br/>businesspeople and in exceptional humanitarian cases.<br/>
Israeli military and security forces can ban West Bank Palestinians from travelling abroad, often on the basis&#160;<br/>of “secret information” that Palestinians cannot review and therefore challenge. These bans have affected&#160;<br/>human rights defenders and activists who travel abroad to advocate for Palestinians’ rights.&#160;<br/>
For Palestinians in Gaza, travel abroad is nearly impossible under Israel’s illegal blockade and tight Egyptian&#160;<br/>restrictions maintained on the Rafah crossing. Gazans must obtain official permits to exit Gaza through&#160;<br/>the Erez crossing from the Israeli Civil Administration, which limits its approval to rare exceptions. This has&#160;<br/>effectively segregated Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from the rest of the OPT, Israel and the rest of the world.<br/>
Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are allowed to travel abroad via the&#160;<br/>same crossings and ports as Jewish citizens. However, they continue to report being subjected to separate&#160;<br/>discriminatory and humiliating security checks and interrogations at Israel’s airports based on their national&#160;<br/>identity, despite some improvements introduced as a result of a legal petition filed in 2007 by an Israeli&#160;<br/>human rights NGO. In addition, the Israeli authorities continue to ban thousands of Palestinian spouses from&#160;<br/>the OPT lawfully residing in Israel under military “stay permits” from enjoying the same right.&#160;<br/>
For Palestinians, travel inside the OPT is difficult, time-consuming and&#160;subordinated to Israeli strategic&#160;<br/>considerations that favour Jewish settlements and their associated infrastructure. In that sense, it&#160;<br/>perpetuates a feeling of powerlessness and domination in Palestinians’ daily lives. Israel imposed a&#160;<br/>comprehensive closure system on the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank following the outbreak of&#160;<br/>the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;in 2000, which remains in effect in various forms. This closure system includes a web of&#160;<br/>hundreds of Israeli military checkpoints, earth mounds and road gates, in addition to blocked roads, and the&#160;<br/>winding fence/wall.<br/>
The 700km fence/wall, which Israel continues building mostly illegally on Palestinian land inside the&#160;<br/>occupied West Bank, has isolated 38 Palestinian localities in the West Bank comprising 9.4% of the area&#160;<br/>of the West Bank, and has trapped them in enclaves known as “seam zones”, forcing residents to obtain&#160;<br/>special permits for entry and exit to their homes and acquire separate permits to access their agricultural land.&#160;<br/>
Israel has generally allowed women aged over 50 and men aged over 55 from the West Bank to enter&#160;<br/>Jerusalem or Israel without permits, but only if they have no “security” record or ban. Meanwhile,&#160;<br/>Palestinians from the Gaza Strip can enter the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, only for urgent and&#160;<br/>life-threatening medical conditions, essential business and exceptional humanitarian cases under Israel’s&#160;<br/>military “separation policy” between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians must obtain Israeli military&#160;<br/>permits – which has become virtually impossible to do – in order to travel between the areas, with no clear&#160;<br/>procedure for making an application or obtaining an outcome.<br/>
The permits regime is a military, bureaucratic and arbitrary procedure which applies only to Palestinians in&#160;<br/>the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It does not apply to Jewish settlers, Israeli citizens or foreign nationals, who&#160;<br/>generally can move freely within the West Bank and between the West Bank and Israel.&#160;<br/>
<b>RESTRICTIONS ON RIGHT TO POLITICAL PARTICIPATION&#160;<br/></b>While Israeli laws and policies define the state as democratic, the fragmentation of the Palestinian people&#160;<br/>ensures that Israel’s version of democracy overwhelmingly privileges political participation by Jewish Israelis.&#160;<br/>In addition, the representation of Palestinian citizens of Israel in the decision-making process, primarily in&#160;<br/>the Knesset, has been restricted and undermined by an array of Israeli laws and policies.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=21></a>Most importantly, Israel’s constitutional law prevents Israeli citizens&#160;from challenging the definition of Israel&#160;<br/>as a Jewish state and in effect any laws that establish such an identity. While Palestinian citizens of Israel&#160;<br/>can vote and run in national elections, in practice their right to political participation is limited, and they&#160;<br/>continue to be perceived as the “enemy from within”.<br/>
Under Israel’s Basic Law: The Knesset of 1958, the Central Elections Committee can disqualify a party or&#160;<br/>candidate from participation in elections if their objectives or actions&#160;are meant to negate the definition of&#160;<br/>Israel as a Jewish and democratic state; incite racism; or support armed struggles by a hostile state or a&#160;<br/>terrorist organization against Israel. In addition, the registration of any party whose goals or actions deny&#160;<br/>either directly or indirectly “the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state” is prohibited under the&#160;<br/>1992 Law on Political Parties.<br/>
Over the years, the Supreme Court has in general overturned attempts by the Central Elections Committee&#160;<br/>to ban Palestinian parties and disqualify Palestinian candidates for violating these provisions on the basis of&#160;<br/>public statements expressing views deemed unacceptable to the majority of Knesset members. However,&#160;<br/>these provisions prevent Palestinian lawmakers from challenging laws that codify Jewish Israeli domination&#160;<br/>over the Palestinian minority, and unduly limit their freedom of expression, and as a result, impede their&#160;<br/>ability to represent the concerns of their constituents effectively.<br/>
Limitations on the right of Palestinian citizens of Israel to participate in elections are accompanied by other&#160;<br/>infringements of their civil and political rights that limit the extent to which they can participate in the political&#160;<br/>and social life of Israel. This has included racialized policing of protests, mass arbitrary arrests and the use&#160;<br/>of unlawful force against protesters during demonstrations against Israeli repression in both Israel and the&#160;<br/>OPT. Such measures, which target peaceful protesters, are aimed to&#160;deter further demonstrations and stifle&#160;<br/>dissent. Upon arrest, Palestinians are routinely placed in pretrial detention; by contrast, Jewish protesters&#160;<br/>are generally granted bail. This points to a discriminatory treatment of Palestinians by the criminal justice&#160;<br/>system, which appears to treat Palestinians as “suspects” instead of assessing the individual threat they pose.&#160;<br/>
Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian civil and political rights, particularly in the West Bank, where&#160;<br/>military orders are still enforced. Israeli authorities have since 1967 outlawed more than 400 Palestinian&#160;<br/>organizations, including all major political parties and several prominent civil society organizations widely&#160;<br/>recognized for the provision of vital services such as legal aid and medical care as well as the quality of their&#160;<br/>human rights reporting and advocacy, most recently in October 2021. In addition, the Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>often prosecute Palestinians for “membership and activity in an unlawful association”, a charge frequently&#160;<br/>levied against anti-occupation activists. Over the years, they have arrested scores of Palestinian lawmakers,&#160;<br/>placing them under administrative detention or prosecuting them in military courts in trials that fail to meet&#160;<br/>international standards. At the same time, Military Order 101 Regarding Prohibition of Incitement and Hostile&#160;<br/>Propaganda Actions punishes and criminalizes Palestinians for attending and organizing an assembly of 10&#160;<br/>or more people without a permit for an issue that “may be construed as political”. The order, which does not&#160;<br/>define what is meant by “political”, effectively bans protests, including&#160;peaceful protests, and stipulates up to&#160;<br/>10 years’ imprisonment and/or hefty fines for anyone breaching it.<br/>
Palestinians in East Jerusalem, on the other hand, are neither able to participate in political life in Israel&#160;<br/>nor in the West Bank. Although they can vote, and run, in municipal elections in Jerusalem, they have&#160;<br/>traditionally boycotted them in protest at Israel’s ongoing occupation and illegal annexation of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, and they remain excluded from national elections.<br/>
As a result, protests remain for Palestinians the only means to influence Israeli politics and challenge the&#160;<br/>system of oppression and domination in the OPT. Palestinians in the OPT have, over the years, mobilized&#160;<br/>and organized non-violent popular resistance against Israel’s military occupation and expansion&#160;of&#160;<br/>settlements, which has been systematically met with excessive and unlawful force, arbitrary arrests&#160;and&#160;<br/>prosecution in military courts, as well as undue restrictions on freedom of movement.&#160;<br/>
Despite the 2005 “disengagement”, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip continue to face Israeli repression for their&#160;<br/>popular resistance against the occupation. This has included excessive and often lethal force during protests&#160;<br/>near the fence that separates Gaza from Israel.<br/>

<a name=22></a><b>DISPOSSESSION OF LAND AND PROPERTY<br/></b>In 1948, Jewish individuals and institutions owned around 6.5% of mandate Palestine, while Palestinians&#160;<br/>owned about 90% of the privately owned land there. Within just over 70 years the situation has been&#160;<br/>reversed.<br/>
Since its creation, the Israeli state has enforced massive and cruel land seizures to dispossess and exclude&#160;<br/>Palestinians from their land and homes. Although Palestinians in Israel and the OPT are subjected to&#160;<br/>different legal and administrative regimes, Israel has used similar land expropriation measures across&#160;<br/>all territorial domains under the Judaization policy, which seeks to maximize Jewish control over land&#160;<br/>while effectively restricting Palestinians to living in separate, densely populated enclaves to minimize their&#160;<br/>presence. This policy has been continuously pursued in Israel since 1948 in areas of strategic importance&#160;<br/>that include significant Palestinian populations such as the Galilee and&#160;the Negev/Naqab, and has been&#160;<br/>extended to the OPT following Israel’s military occupation in 1967. Today, ongoing Israeli efforts to coerce&#160;<br/>the transfer of Palestinians in the Negev/Naqab, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank under&#160;<br/>discriminatory planning and building regimes are the “new frontiers of dispossession” of Palestinians, and&#160;<br/>the manifestation of the strategy of Judaization and territorial control.&#160;<br/>
The land regime established soon after Israel’s creation, which was never dismantled, remains a crucial&#160;<br/>aspect of the system of oppression and domination against Palestinians. It consisted of legislation,&#160;<br/>reinterpretation of existing British and Ottoman laws, governmental and semi-governmental land institutions,&#160;<br/>and a supportive judiciary that enabled the acquisition of Palestinian land and its discriminatory reallocation&#160;<br/>across all territories under its control.&#160;<br/>
While much of the seizure of Palestinian land and property and the destruction of their villages inside&#160;<br/>Israel occurred in the late 1940s and 1950s, massive and racially motivated dispossessions continued into&#160;<br/>the 1970s. The effects continue to severely impact Palestinians. They are still prohibited from accessing&#160;<br/>and using land and property that belonged to them or their families in 1948. The dispossession has also&#160;<br/>contributed to the isolation and exclusion of Palestinian citizens from Israeli society, marking them as a&#160;<br/>group with perpetual lesser rights and with no right to claim access to lands and properties that have been in&#160;<br/>their families for generations.&#160;<br/>
Three main pieces of legislation made up the core of the Israeli land regime and played a major role in&#160;<br/>this process: the Absentees’ Property Law (Transfer of Property Law) of 1950; the Land Acquisition Law of&#160;<br/>1953, which retroactively “legalized” expropriation of lands that the state, newly established Jewish localities&#160;<br/>and the Israeli army had taken control of using emergency regulations after the 1947-49 conflict; and the&#160;<br/>British Land (Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance of 1943, which&#160;enabled the minister of finance to&#160;<br/>expropriate land for any public purpose. The laws, which remain in force, were instrumental in expropriating&#160;<br/>and acquiring Palestinian land and property, leading over the years to their exclusive ownership by the Israeli&#160;<br/>state and Jewish national institutions. Since East Jerusalem’s annexation in 1967, the entire Israeli land&#160;<br/>regime has been utilized in East Jerusalem for the expropriation of Palestinian land and its conversion mainly&#160;<br/>to state land. Israeli authorities have also enacted additional legal tools that affect Palestinian land and&#160;<br/>housing rights in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>
The Absentees’ Property Law effectively gave the state control over all property belonging to Palestinians who&#160;<br/>were expelled or fled their homes, regardless of whether or not they&#160;became refugees outside the country&#160;<br/>or were internally displaced from their villages and homes and had settled inside Israel, mostly in nearby&#160;<br/>Palestinian villages. They were deemed “absentees” even though they never crossed an international border&#160;<br/>and, in many cases, remained within a few kilometres of their homes and land.&#160;<br/>
The destruction of the Palestinian village of Iqrit near Acre in northern Israel is a clear example of the&#160;<br/>cruel application of this policy. In 1948, the Israeli army instructed about 600 residents of Iqrit to leave&#160;<br/>their homes “temporarily”. They were never allowed to return. The residents petitioned the Supreme Court&#160;<br/>of Israel to be granted their right of return, and won. However, the Israeli Ministry of Defense refused to&#160;<br/>implement the decision, fearing it would create a precedent for the return of other Palestinians forced out&#160;<br/>

<a name=23></a>of their villages. So, in 1951, the ministry destroyed the village except for the church and cemetery. The&#160;<br/>Palestinian community of Iqrit now comprises around 1,500 individuals who mostly live 20km away in Al-<br/>Rameh. They continue to fight for their right to return to their homes&#160;and land in Iqrit.<br/>
Parallel to direct land expropriation by the Israeli government, all pre-1948 Jewish properties in annexed&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem held by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property were transferred to the Israeli Custodian&#160;<br/>General under an amendment to the 1970 Legal and Administrative Matters Law. The law allowed the&#160;<br/>original Jewish owner, or their lawful heirs to request the Custodian General to release such properties back&#160;<br/>to them. It applies only to Jewish property owners, not to Palestinians whose properties in West Jerusalem&#160;<br/>were confiscated after 1948, and is a clearly discriminatory compensation scheme.&#160;<br/>
According to one estimate, Israel has expropriated over 10,000 shops, 25,000 buildings and almost 60% of&#160;<br/>the fertile land belonging to Palestinian refugees in Israel and East Jerusalem under the Absentees’ Property&#160;<br/>Law.&#160;<br/>
In addition to the Israeli state’s allocation of confiscated Palestinian&#160;land for advancing Jewish settlement&#160;<br/>in Jerusalem, Jewish settler organizations such as Ateret Cohanim and Elad have relied on the 1950&#160;<br/>Absentees’ Property Law and the 1970 Legal and Administrative Matters Law to devise a legal scheme to&#160;<br/>file eviction cases against Palestinians and dispossess them of their&#160;properties, allow Jewish settlers to settle&#160;<br/>in predominantly Palestinian neighbourhoods, and further the expansion of Jewish settlements. According&#160;<br/>to estimates by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in 2019, there were&#160;<br/>199 Palestinian families, comprising 877 people, facing eviction cases, mainly in the Old City and the&#160;<br/>neighbourhoods of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan. Land and property grabs by settlers’ organizations have been&#160;<br/>taking place with the assistance of state institutions, including the Custodian General, the Jewish National&#160;<br/>Fund and the judiciary.<br/>
Israel resorted to emergency and military legislation, some of which&#160;mirrored Israeli civil laws, to confiscate&#160;<br/>Palestinian land in the rest of the West Bank and, until its unilateral withdrawal in 2005, in the Gaza Strip as&#160;<br/>well, in order to establish and maintain its control over the territory by building and expanding settlements&#160;<br/>and their related infrastructure, setting up national parks, archaeological&#160;sites and military “firing zones”.&#160;<br/>In the first decade of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli authorities proceeded to&#160;<br/>confiscate privately owned Palestinian land mainly through requisition&#160;orders for alleged military needs, in&#160;<br/>addition to expropriation orders, absentee property orders and military orders declaring specific areas as&#160;<br/>“closed military zones”. These measures were legitimized by the Supreme Court of Israel, which ultimately&#160;<br/>rendered the question of the legality of the settlements non-justiciable.<br/>
In addition to laws, Israel has used a selective registration of ownership rights, a discriminatory allocation&#160;<br/>of expropriated Palestinian land for Jewish settlement and a discriminatory urban planning and zoning&#160;<br/>regime to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their land and properties. The result has been the deliberate&#160;<br/>impoverishment of the Palestinian population both within Israel and in the OPT.<br/>
The land title settlement process, initiated under the British mandate before 1948, became an additional&#160;<br/>tool for Israel’s dispossession of Palestinians across all territorial domains&#160;and, ultimately, enabled the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities to transfer millions of dunams (hundreds of thousands of hectares) of state land for Jewish&#160;<br/>settlement. The Israeli authorities pursued this policy aggressively in the OPT following a 1979 Supreme&#160;<br/>Court decision, which held that the Elon Moreh settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus was illegal&#160;<br/>because its purpose was not military, forcing them to drastically reduce the use of requisition orders.&#160;<br/>
In parallel, the Israeli government enabled Jewish localities and settlements to use the expropriated lands.&#160;<br/>In Israel and East Jerusalem, it transferred from the state to Jewish national organizations and institutions,&#160;<br/>many of which serve Jews only, while the legal title of the land remained in the state’s name. In the rest of&#160;<br/>the OPT, the Israeli government adopted policies that allowed the allocation of state land almost exclusively&#160;<br/>to Israeli state institutions and organizations, state and private companies, for the benefit of Jewish Israeli&#160;<br/>settlers.<br/>

The establishment and promotion of Israeli settlements in the OPT, which are illegal under international law,&#160;<br/>and populating them with Jewish Israeli civilians has been an Israeli government policy since 1967. To date,&#160;<br/>some 38% of land in East Jerusalem has been expropriated from Palestinians, most of it privately owned.&#160;<br/>The Israeli authorities have used these major land expropriations for the construction of 13 Jewish Israeli&#160;<br/>settlements in strategic locations to surround Palestinian neighbourhoods and therefore disrupt Palestinians’&#160;<br/>geographic contiguity and urban development.<br/>
In&#160;the rest of&#160;the&#160;West&#160;Bank,&#160;between&#160;1967 and&#160;2009,&#160;Israel&#160;increased the&#160;total&#160;area&#160;of&#160;state land from&#160;some&#160;<br/>530,000 dunams to 1.4 million dunams, the vast majority of it located in Area C, and allocated nearly half of&#160;<br/>it for civilian use. Of this, some 99.76% (674,459 dunams) was allocated for the exclusive benefit of Israeli&#160;<br/>settlements, according to information provided by the Israeli military in 2018 to the Israeli NGO Peace Now.&#160;<br/>Today, Israeli settlements cover nearly 10% of the West Bank, and their regional councils have jurisdiction&#160;<br/>over roughly 63% of Area C (or 40% of the West Bank), where most settlers live. At the end of 2020, there&#160;<br/>were 272 settlements and outposts in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem), in which over 441,600&#160;<br/>Israeli settlers were living. As of July 2021, an additional 225,178 Jewish Israeli settlers were living in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, which was then home to 358,800 Palestinians.&#160;<br/>
Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are meant to be permanent places of&#160;<br/>residence or economic activity for Jewish Israelis and are built solely to serve their needs. The Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities provide subsidies, tax incentives and low-cost utilities and resources to encourage Jewish Israelis&#160;<br/>to live in these places and to support the settlement economy.&#160;<br/>
While Israel no longer seizes houses and land from Palestinians in Gaza, it uses unlawful lethal force to&#160;<br/>control and restrict Palestinians’ movement in the “buffer zone” separating the territory from Israel and a&#160;<br/>similarly access-restricted maritime area off Gaza’s coast. According to human rights organizations, the&#160;<br/>“buffer zone” extends to a distance between 300m and 1,500m from the fence and covers a total of about&#160;<br/>62km2, or roughly 17% of the total area of the Gaza Strip. It covers over 35% of the agricultural land in Gaza.&#160;<br/>Meanwhile, the access-restricted maritime area covers 85% of its fishing waters.&#160;<br/>
<b>DISCRIMINATORY ZONING AND PLANNING POLICIES<br/></b>In tandem with the system of land ownership and allocation, zoning and planning policies have been central&#160;<br/>in fulfilling Israel’s policies of establishing Jewish control while marginalizing Palestinian communities in both&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT. Planning has been used to expand the Jewish Israeli presence in strategic locations; build&#160;<br/>Jewish towns, cities and settlements; obstruct the geographical expansion of Palestinian towns and centres;&#160;<br/>and regulate land use and Palestinian access to land for development by zoning it as green areas, industrial&#160;<br/>zones or military zones. Such planning was used, for example, to enclose Palestinian localities or erase&#160;<br/>Palestinian villages that were demolished after 1948 by designating them as military zones or national parks.&#160;<br/>
In all areas where Israel exercises full control (in Israel, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank), a local&#160;<br/>outline plan sets out the policy for use of the land for purposes such as residence, industry and green space,&#160;<br/>serves as the legal basis for granting building permits and is the main tool through which central government&#160;<br/>enables local development. In Israel and East Jerusalem, a local outline plan can only be prepared by an&#160;<br/>official governmental authority under the Planning and Building Law&#160;of 1965. However, state planners fail to&#160;<br/>provide adequate plans for Palestinian localities that consider the needs of the residents.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=25></a>Similarly, in Area C of West Bank, the Israeli Civil Administration’s planning system does not allow for any&#160;<br/>Palestinian representation or meaningful participation and, as a result, does not take account of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population’s needs, and consistently privileges the interests of Israeli settlers. At the same time, the Israeli&#160;<br/>Civil Administration uses a selective interpretation of Jordanian law to insist that planning must conform with&#160;<br/>outdated British mandate plans, and routinely rejects applications for building permits on this basis.&#160;<br/>
These discriminatory measures lead to unregulated building and subsequent demolitions in both Israel and&#160;<br/>the OPT.<br/>
The result has been the complete absence of new Palestinian developments. Since 1948 the state has&#160;<br/>established more than 700 Jewish localities in Israel, whereas it has not established any new locality for&#160;<br/>Palestinians except for the state-planned Bedouin townships in the Negev/Naqab designed for the forced&#160;<br/>urbanization of Bedouins.<br/>
According to an estimate by the Mossawa Center, an NGO, in 2019, around 50,000 structures were built&#160;<br/>by Palestinian citizens of Israel without a building permit. Under the Planning and Building Law of 1965,&#160;<br/>any building or development without a building permit can be “demolished, dismantled or removed” by&#160;<br/>relevant Israeli authorities, and its owner may be liable for the cost of the demolition as well as a fine and/or&#160;<br/>imprisonment. Between 2012 and 2014, 97% of administrative demolition orders were issued in what Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities label the Arab sector, comprising mainly Palestinian citizens of Israel, but also the much smaller&#160;<br/>Druze minority.<br/>
The Negev/Naqab is a prime example of how Israel’s discriminatory planning and building policies are&#160;<br/>designed to maximize land and resources for Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinian land and housing&#160;<br/>rights. Instead of zoning Palestinian Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab as residential areas, since the&#160;<br/>1970s, the Israeli authorities have zoned the villages and the lands around them for military, industrial or&#160;<br/>public use. Over the years, Israel has recognized 11 of these villages but 35 remain “unrecognized” with&#160;<br/>residents considered to engage in “illegal squatting” and unable to apply for a building permit to legalize&#160;<br/>their established or new homes as the lands are not designated as residential. The buildings of whole&#160;<br/>communities have been repeatedly demolished as a result. By contrast, Israeli courts have retroactively&#160;<br/>approved Jewish communities built without outline plans and building permits in the same area. The lack of&#160;<br/>official status also means that the Israeli authorities do not provide these villages any essential infrastructure&#160;<br/>or services such as healthcare or education, and residents have no representation in the different local&#160;<br/>governmental bodies as they cannot register for or participate in municipal elections.&#160;<br/>
Similarly, the deliberate refusal to approve zoning plans for Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>has had a ruinous effect on Palestinian communities hindering their development, including the construction&#160;<br/>of public spaces, schools and commercial zones for employment opportunities. Palestinians live in&#160;<br/>underdeveloped and densely populated areas in East Jerusalem; they face an acute shortage of housing&#160;<br/>while entire neighbourhoods are exposed to a risk of demolition for unlicensed building.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians&#160;comprise&#160;60% of the&#160;population in&#160;East Jerusalem&#160;today, but only 15%&#160;of&#160;the land&#160;is designated&#160;<br/>by the Israeli planning authorities for Palestinian residence, with 2.6% of this land zoned for public buildings.&#160;<br/>According to data from Peace Now, from 1991 to 2018, only 16.5% of the applications for building permits&#160;<br/>approved in Jerusalem were for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, compared to 37.8% for Jewish settlements&#160;<br/>in East Jerusalem. The remaining applications approved were for West Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>
In Area C of the West Bank, the deeply discriminatory urban planning and zoning system means that, in&#160;<br/>practice, Palestinians are only allowed to build on about 0.5% (roughly 1,800 hectares) of Area C, most&#160;<br/>of which is already built-up. Meanwhile, Israeli authorities have allocated 70% of the land in Area C to&#160;<br/>settlements. In July 2019, the Israeli Security Cabinet promised to grant building permits for 715 housing&#160;<br/>units for Palestinians. By contrast, it promised building permits for 6,000 housing units for Jewish settlers.&#160;<br/>By the end of June 2020, only one building permit had been issued for Palestinians. By contrast, 1,094&#160;<br/>building permits were issued for Jewish settlements between July 2019 and March 2020.<br/>

<a name=26></a><b>SUPPRESSION OF PALESTINIANS’ HUMAN DEVELOPMENT<br/></b>Decades of deliberately unequal treatment of Palestinians in all areas under the control of Israel has left&#160;<br/>Palestinians marginalized and subject to widespread and systematic socio-economic disadvantage as they&#160;<br/>are barred from equitable access to natural and financial resources,&#160;livelihood opportunities, healthcare and&#160;<br/>education. Discriminatory treatment and allocation of resources by Israeli authorities for the benefit of Jewish&#160;<br/>Israeli citizens in Israel and Israeli settlers in the OPT compound the inequalities on the ground.&#160;<br/>
Across Israel and the OPT, millions of Palestinians live in densely populated areas that are generally&#160;<br/>underdeveloped and lack adequate essential services such as garbage collection, electricity, public&#160;<br/>transportation and water and sanitation infrastructure. In areas under full Israeli control such as the Negev/<br/>Naqab, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank, the denial of essential services is inherently linked to&#160;<br/>discriminatory planning and zoning policies, and is intended to create unbearable living conditions to force&#160;<br/>Palestinians to leave their homes to allow for the expansion of Jewish settlement. In addition, Israeli policies&#160;<br/>of exclusion, segregation and severe restrictions on movement in the entirety of the West Bank and the&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip mean that Palestinians face difficulties accessing healthcare, including life-saving treatment, and&#160;<br/>education even though Israel bears the responsibility under international law to provide such services not&#160;<br/>just to its own population but also to Palestinians living under its military occupation. When they manage to&#160;<br/>access such services, they are in general inferior to those provided to Jewish Israeli citizens. These policies&#160;<br/>severely impact Palestinians’ socio-economic rights and prevent them&#160;from fulfilling their human potential.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians living in Israel and the OPT are unambiguously disadvantaged across all well-being indicators&#160;<br/>for which measures are available. They experience higher rates of poverty, and lower levels of labour force&#160;<br/>participation, educational attainment and health than Jewish Israelis, including settlers living in the occupied&#160;<br/>West Bank. Their lack of enjoyment of a range of economic and social rights is a direct result not only of&#160;<br/>their segregation from Jewish Israelis but also from each other through severe restrictions on movement, and&#160;<br/>the subjugation of Palestinian human development to the socio-economic interests of Jewish Israelis. Israel&#160;<br/>maintains Jewish domination over the Palestinian economy through the exclusion and intentional neglect of&#160;<br/>Palestinian communities inside Israel, and the creation of a regime of economic dependency in the OPT in&#160;<br/>the context of a prolonged military occupation.&#160;<br/>
Socio-economic gaps between Palestinian and Jewish Israeli citizens are the result of discriminatory policies&#160;<br/>pursued over decades. Historically, Israel prevented its Palestinian citizens from accessing livelihoods under&#160;<br/>its 18-year-long military rule, and used them, at different times, as a source of cheap labour in order to&#160;<br/>preserve the interests of the Jewish majority. In addition to cruel land seizures, other discriminatory policies&#160;<br/>have led to Palestinians’ social and economic deprivation: the exclusion of Palestinian localities from high&#160;<br/>priority areas for development, the discriminatory allocation of land and water for agriculture as well as&#160;<br/>discriminatory planning and zoning, and the failure to implement major infrastructure development projects&#160;<br/>in Palestinian communities.&#160;<br/>
Without zoning plans, Palestinian communities have been unable to designate land for housing and&#160;<br/>industrial use or establish the infrastructure needed for economic development. Today, only 2% of industrial&#160;<br/>zones in Israel, which generate a significant tax income, are located&#160;within Palestinian localities, which are&#160;<br/>poorly connected to other parts of Israel by public transportation or main roads. As a result, Palestinian&#160;<br/>communities in Israel lack the infrastructure required for economic development, forcing their population to&#160;<br/>seek employment in the Jewish sector, where they face institutional discrimination when competing for jobs.&#160;<br/>
They also experience discrimination in the allocation of public resources, most of which are distributed to&#160;<br/>Jewish localities. For example, Palestinian local authorities collect less tax revenue, largely because of the&#160;<br/>disparity in income from non-residential or business taxes, which is in turn the result of discriminatory Israeli&#160;<br/>policies. Palestinian localities also receive lower subsidies from the central government intended for specific&#160;<br/>expenditures, such as education, welfare, health and cultural services. According to a 2018 survey by the&#160;<br/>Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, monthly public expenditure on education and culture in the Jewish sector&#160;<br/>was nearly three times more per capita than in the (predominantly Palestinian) Arab sector.<br/>

<a name=27></a>Across the OPT, Israel’s policies of territorial fragmentation and segregation pursued in the context of&#160;<br/>a prolonged military occupation have had a devastating effect on the performance of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>economy, leaving it disconnected, weak and subordinate to Israel’s geo-demographic goals, and unable to&#160;<br/>achieve sustainable and equitable development for the Palestinian population. Whilst the situation in the&#160;<br/>OPT has improved over recent decades with regards to some social rights, including maternal mortality,&#160;<br/>levels of literacy and education and vaccination rates, in general, living standards have been stagnating or&#160;<br/>deteriorating with access to healthcare, employment, education and housing being particularly affected.<br/>
The 1994 Paris Protocol between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) entrenched the&#160;<br/>dependence of the Palestinian economy on Israel via a customs union that leaves no space for independent&#160;<br/>Palestinian economic policies, tying the OPT to the trade policies, tariff structure and value-added tax rate of&#160;<br/>Israel. Since 1999, Palestinian gross domestic product (GDP) in the OPT has effectively remained stagnant.&#160;<br/>The Palestinian economy suffers from numerous restrictions by Israel on trade that impact on the production&#160;<br/>of exports and importable goods. Almost all Palestinian imports and exports transit ports and crossing points&#160;<br/>controlled by Israel, where delays and security measures increase costs by an average of USD 538 per&#160;<br/>shipment, resulting in a significant and persistent trade deficit.&#160;<br/>
In addition, Israel imposed a “dual use” policy in 2007 that restricts the entry of any goods it deems&#160;<br/>to potentially have military, as well as civilian, use, including chemicals and technology. The list of 117&#160;<br/>liable items is vague, including categories such as “communications equipment, communication support&#160;<br/>equipment, or equipment with communication functions” that can include items that are found in everyday&#160;<br/>use, such as home appliances and medical equipment. This policy only applies to Palestinian importers&#160;<br/>in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, not to their Israeli counterparts or even to Israeli settlers in the OPT. It&#160;<br/>has had a devastating impact on the economy in general, especially on the agriculture, information and&#160;<br/>communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing sectors, and has had catastrophic effects in the Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip in particular.<br/>
Meanwhile, by physically separating East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, since the second&#160;<br/><i>intifada</i>&#160;the Israeli authorities have hindered Palestinians’ ability to access livelihoods and considerably&#160;<br/>reduced the city’s role as the main commercial centre for the West Bank. According to the UN Conference&#160;<br/>on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), between 1993 and 2013, the Palestinian economy in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem shrunk by approximately 50%, while the fence/wall caused over USD 1 billion of direct losses to&#160;<br/>Palestinians in East Jerusalem in the first 10 years since the start of&#160;its construction. Elsewhere in the West&#160;<br/>Bank, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Israeli-imposed movement restrictions cost&#160;<br/>Palestinians 60 million lost work hours per year (equivalent to USD 274 million).&#160;<br/>
The blockade and Israel’s repeated military offensives have had a heavy toll on Gaza’s essential&#160;<br/>infrastructure and further debilitated its health system and economy, leaving the area in a state of perpetual&#160;<br/>humanitarian crisis. Indeed, Israel’s collective punishment of Gaza’s civilian population, the majority of whom&#160;<br/>are children, has created conditions inimical to human life due to shortages of housing, potable water and&#160;<br/>electricity, and lack of access to essential medicines and medical care, food, educational equipment and&#160;<br/>building materials.&#160;<br/>
According to UNCTAD, between 2007 and 2018, due to the Israeli blockade, Gaza’s share of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>economy decreased from 31% to 18%. As a result, more than 1 million people were pushed below the&#160;<br/>poverty line, with the rate of poverty increasing from 40% in 2007 to 56% in 2017. This entrenched the&#160;<br/>dependence of more than 80% of the population on international assistance.<br/>
The collapse of Gaza’s economy caused by the blockade has been exacerbated by four Israeli military&#160;<br/>offensives in the past 13 years, which have caused huge destruction to civilian property and essential&#160;<br/>infrastructure including electricity, water and sewerage and sanitation plants in addition to killing at least&#160;<br/>2,700 Palestinian civilians as well as injuring and displacing tens of thousands of others. During this period&#160;<br/>Palestinian armed groups have fired thousands of indiscriminate rockets towards cities and towns in Israel&#160;<br/>killing or injuring dozens of civilians. In 2019, UNCTAD estimated the cost of the three Israeli military&#160;<br/>operations in Gaza between 2008 and 2014 to be at least three times the GDP of Gaza.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=28></a>Severe movement restrictions have a particularly detrimental effect on the agriculture sector. Prior to 1967,&#160;<br/>the agriculture sector employed about a quarter of the labour force in the West Bank and contributed about&#160;<br/>a third of its GDP and exports. Following the occupation, the Israeli authorities have deprived Palestinians&#160;<br/>and their economy of 63% of the most fertile and best grazing land located in Area C by building settlements&#160;<br/>and the fence/wall, and imposing severe restrictions on Palestinians’ movement and ability to access their&#160;<br/>land.&#160;<br/>
The fence/wall has isolated more than 10% of the area of the West Bank, directly affecting 219 Palestinian&#160;<br/>localities and causing approximately 80% of Palestinian farmers who have land in the “seam zone” between&#160;<br/>the fence/wall and the Green Line to lose access to such land. Farmers wishing to access their farmland in&#160;<br/>the “seam zone” are required to obtain military permits, which they must renew repeatedly. For those who&#160;<br/>manage to obtain them, access is only permitted on foot and through the specific agricultural gates that&#160;<br/>appear on the permits.<br/>
In addition, Israel ensures that over 35% of agricultural land in Gaza&#160;and 85% of the fishing area along the&#160;<br/>Gaza coast are off-limits to Palestinians, enforced by the “buffer zone” and access-restricted maritime area.&#160;<br/>An estimated 178,000 people, including 113,000 farmers, can no longer access the farmland in the “buffer&#160;<br/>zone”. Since 2014, the Israeli military has aerial-sprayed herbicides over Palestinian crops along the fence&#160;<br/>between Gaza and Israel, resulting in the loss of livelihoods for Gazan farmers, with far-reaching health&#160;<br/>implications. Although Israel claims that the spraying is intended to “enable optimal and continuous security&#160;<br/>operations”, it has not provided any evidence to support this claim.&#160;<br/>
Ever since the discovery of oil and gas off Gaza’s coast, Israel has repeatedly changed the demarcation of&#160;<br/>Gaza’s maritime coast, sometimes reducing it to just 3 nautical miles. The lack of access to sufficient fishing&#160;<br/>waters affects an estimated 65,000 Gazans, and has impoverished nearly 90% of fishermen. Additionally,&#160;<br/>the Israeli navy uses lethal force against Gazan fishermen working off the coast, and sinks and seizes their&#160;<br/>boats.<br/>
In addition to denying Palestinians’ access to livelihoods through severe restrictions on movement, the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities have systematically and unlawfully appropriated Palestinians’ natural resources for the&#160;<br/>economic benefit of their own citizens in Israel and in the settlements, in violation of international law. Israel’s&#160;<br/>exploitation of Palestinian natural resources of fertile agricultural land, water, oil, gas, stone and Dead Sea&#160;<br/>minerals deprives Palestinians of equal access to or the opportunity&#160;to administer, develop and benefit from&#160;<br/>their own resources. This severely impinges on their access to livelihoods and socio-economic rights, such&#160;<br/>as the rights to food and an adequate standard of living.&#160;<br/>
Israel’s control of water resources and water-related infrastructure in the OPT results in striking inequalities&#160;<br/>between Palestinians and Jewish settlers. The Israeli authorities restrict Palestinians’ access to water in the&#160;<br/>West Bank through military orders, which prevent them from building any new water installation without first&#160;<br/>obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. They are unable to drill new wells, install pumps or deepen existing&#160;<br/>wells, and are denied access to the Jordan River and freshwater springs. Israel even controls the collection&#160;<br/>of rainwater in most of the West Bank, and the Israeli army often destroys rainwater-harvesting cisterns&#160;<br/>owned by Palestinian communities. Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, the coastal aquifer has been depleted by&#160;<br/>Israeli over-extraction and contaminated by sewage and seawater infiltration, resulting in more than 95% of&#160;<br/>its water being unfit for human consumption.&#160;<br/>
As a result of these policies, average Palestinian consumption of water in the OPT is about 70 litres a day&#160;<br/>per person, with approximately 420,000 people in the West Bank consuming 50 litres a day, less than a&#160;<br/>quarter of the average Israeli consumption of about 300 litres per person. For Israeli settlers residing in&#160;<br/>Israeli settlements, the average daily water consumption is 369 litres, about six times the amount consumed&#160;<br/>by Palestinians. &#160;According to the UN, 90% of households in Gaza, which are already impoverished, have to&#160;<br/>buy water from desalination or purification plants, costing between 10&#160;and 30 times more than piped water.<br/>
The Israeli government discriminates when providing funds to the health system serving Palestinian citizens&#160;<br/>of Israel, even though they have worse health than their Jewish Israeli counterparts, and does not provide&#160;<br/>any healthcare facilities to Palestinian Bedouins living in unrecognized villages in the Negev/Naqab, forcing&#160;<br/>

<a name=29></a>them to travel long distances to seek medical care. This is reflected in&#160;significant health gaps between the&#160;<br/>Jewish and (predominantly Palestinian) Arab populations, with the latter universally scoring worse in official&#160;<br/>statistics. For example, in 2019 infant mortality for Arab citizens of Israel (5.4 per 1,000 births) was more&#160;<br/>than double that for Jewish Israelis (2.4).<br/>
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel’s half-a-century-long military occupation does not just impact&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ standard of health but also their ability to access the necessary care and treatment, in particular&#160;<br/>specialized treatment for serious medical conditions available in many cases only in East Jerusalem, Israel&#160;<br/>or abroad. Those referred for medical treatment in East Jerusalem or Israel must apply for an Israeli military&#160;<br/>permit on humanitarian grounds. Such permits are difficult to obtain&#160;and often issued with a delay or denied.&#160;<br/>The permit regime has a particularly devastating impact on the health of Palestinians in Gaza where the&#160;<br/>blockade, coupled with a chronic energy crisis, has undermined the availability and quality of health services&#160;<br/>and left the system close to collapse.&#160;<br/>
Finally, Israel discriminates against Palestinian students in Israel and East Jerusalem, who receive less&#160;<br/>funding than their Jewish counterparts at all levels of school education. An analysis by the Mossawa Center&#160;<br/>of the Israeli Ministry of Education’s 2016 budget found that (predominantly Palestinian) Arab students from&#160;<br/>disadvantaged backgrounds received 30% less funding per learning hours in primary education, 50% less&#160;<br/>funding at the intermediate school level and 75% less funding at the secondary school level than Jewish&#160;<br/>students with the same socio-economic status.<br/>
<b>A SYSTEM OF APARTHEID<br/></b>Israel has created and maintains an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination over&#160;<br/>Palestinians, which is enforced across Israel and the OPT through reinforcing discriminatory laws, policies&#160;<br/>and practices, and, when seen as a totality, controls virtually every aspect of Palestinians’ lives and routinely&#160;<br/>violates their human rights.<br/>
This system of apartheid has been built and maintained over decades by successive Israeli governments&#160;<br/>across all territories they have controlled, regardless of the political party in power at the time. Israel has&#160;<br/>subjected different groups of Palestinians to different sets of discriminatory and exclusionary laws, policies&#160;<br/>and practices at different times, responding to the territorial gains it made first in 1948 and then in 1967,&#160;<br/>when it annexed East Jerusalem and occupied the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Over decades,&#160;<br/>Israeli demographic and geopolitical considerations have shaped policies towards Palestinians in each of&#160;<br/>these territorial domains.&#160;<br/>
Although Israel’s system of apartheid manifests itself in different ways in the various areas under its&#160;<br/>effective control, it consistently has the same purpose of oppressing and dominating Palestinians for the&#160;<br/>benefit of Jewish Israelis, who are privileged under Israeli civil law regardless of where they reside. It is&#160;<br/>designed to maintain an overwhelming Jewish majority with access&#160;to and benefiting from the maximum&#160;<br/>amount of territory and land acquired or controlled, while restricting the right of Palestinians to challenge&#160;<br/>the dispossession of their land and property. This system has been applied wherever Israel has exercised&#160;<br/>effective control over territory and land or over the exercise of the rights of Palestinians. It is realized in law,&#160;<br/>policy and practice, and reflected in the discourse of the state from its establishment and until this day.&#160;<br/>
While international law applies differently to the situations in Israel and in the OPT, this fact does not excuse&#160;<br/>prohibited discrimination against Palestinians in any of the areas under Israel’s control. Israel’s treatment&#160;<br/>of Palestinians inside Israel is governed by international human rights law, to the exclusion of international&#160;<br/>humanitarian law. In the OPT, Israel’s conduct is bound both by the rules of international humanitarian law&#160;<br/>relevant to military occupation (law of occupation) and its obligations under international human rights law. The&#160;<br/>law of occupation allows, and in some cases requires, differential treatment between nationals of the occupying&#160;<br/>power and the population of the occupied territory. However, it does not allow the occupying power to do this&#160;<br/>where the intention is to establish or maintain a regime of systematic racial oppression and domination.<br/>

<a name=30></a>The continuing forced displacement of a majority of Palestinians from their land and property in 1947-49&#160;<br/>and subsequently in 1967; the forced deportations, forcible transfers and arbitrary restrictions on their&#160;<br/>freedom of movement; the denial of nationality and the right of return; the racialized and discriminatory&#160;<br/>dispossession of their lands and property; and the subsequent discriminatory allocation of and access to&#160;<br/>national resources (including land, housing and water) combine not only to hinder Palestinians’ current&#160;<br/>enjoyment of their rights, including access to livelihood, employment, healthcare, food security, water&#160;<br/>and sanitation, and education opportunities, but also to ensure that Palestinians cannot as individuals or&#160;<br/>communities enjoy a status equal to that of Jewish Israelis in Israel, the OPT and other situations where&#160;<br/>Israel exercises control over Palestinians’ enjoyment of their rights, particularly the right of return.<br/>
The racial discrimination against and segregation of Palestinians is the result of deliberate government&#160;<br/>policy. The regular violations of Palestinians’ rights are not accidental repetitions of offences, but part of an&#160;<br/>institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination.<br/>
<b>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY<br/></b>Israel and individuals acting on its behalf have been, in the process of establishing and maintaining a system&#160;<br/>of domination and oppression over Palestinians, systematically perpetrating inhuman and inhumane acts as&#160;<br/>proscribed, respectively, by the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has examined specifically the inhuman or inhumane acts of forcible transfer,&#160;<br/>administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic freedoms&#160;<br/>or persecution committed against the Palestinian population in Israel and the OPT, which are associated&#160;<br/>with and enforce the system of discriminatory laws, policies and practices described above. The organization&#160;<br/>has concluded that the patterns of proscribed acts perpetuated by Israel both inside Israel and in the OPT&#160;<br/>form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population, and that&#160;<br/>the inhuman or inhumane acts committed within the context of this attack have been committed with the&#160;<br/>intention to maintain this system and amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid under both the&#160;<br/>Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute.&#160;<br/>
<b>FORCIBLE TRANSFERS&#160;<br/></b>Israel implements a myriad of laws and policies to force Palestinians in Israel and the OPT into small&#160;<br/>enclaves or to leave the territory altogether. In the Negev/Naqab in Israel, East Jerusalem and Area C of&#160;<br/>the West Bank, which are under full Israeli control, Israeli authorities enforce similar planning and building&#160;<br/>regimes against the Palestinian population, which result in widespread and similar patterns of home and&#160;<br/>property demolitions, including structures directly linked to livelihoods, on grounds of the lack of building&#160;<br/>permits. They deny communities in these areas the provision of essential services, and in the case of the&#160;<br/>OPT take no action against violent attacks by Israeli settlers. Together, these policies create a coercive&#160;<br/>environment that aims to force Palestinians to abandon their homes.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians are caught in a Catch-22 situation. Israel requires them to obtain a permit to build or even erect&#160;<br/>a structure such as a tent, but rarely issues them a permit. Consequently, to have shelter or develop their&#160;<br/>communities, Palestinians build without a permit. Israeli forces then demolish the structures on the basis&#160;<br/>that they were built without a permit. By contrast, Israeli authorities freely allow amendments to plans to&#160;<br/>promote development where they are setting up Jewish cities in Israel or Israeli settlements in the OPT.&#160;<br/>
Since 1948, Israel has demolished tens of thousands of Palestinian homes and other properties across all&#160;<br/>areas under its jurisdiction and effective control. This includes the destruction of more than 500 Palestinian&#160;<br/>villages in what became Israel following the 1947-49 conflict. Those&#160;affected are some of the poorest and&#160;<br/>most marginalized communities in both Israeli and Palestinian society, often refugees or internally displaced&#160;<br/>persons, who are forced to rely on family and humanitarian actors for shelter and livelihoods.&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>Israel’s revocation of the permanent residency status of thousands of Palestinians in East Jerusalem has&#160;<br/>similarly resulted in forcible transfers.&#160;<br/>
Additionally, Israel has deliberately destroyed homes and displaced civilians during military operations,&#160;<br/>rendering tens of thousands of Palestinians homeless and displaced. The evidence suggests that most of the&#160;<br/>destruction was not justified by military necessity and amounted to violations of international humanitarian&#160;<br/>law. Considered within the context of the system of oppression and domination, the violations contribute to&#160;<br/>maintaining this system of apartheid.<br/>
Israel’s discriminatory state policies, regulations and conduct against Palestinians in Israel and the OPT have&#160;<br/>involved the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer under both the Rome Statute and&#160;<br/>Apartheid Convention.<br/>
<b>ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION, TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT<br/></b>Since the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, the Israeli authorities have made widespread&#160;<br/>use of administrative detention to imprison thousands of Palestinians, including children without charge&#160;<br/>or trial under renewable detention orders. The military judicial system in the OPT has used these orders to&#160;<br/>lock away thousands of Palestinians, including children, for months and at times years. Israel regularly uses&#160;<br/>administrative detention against political opponents of the occupation. By contrast, administrative detention&#160;<br/>has rarely been used to detain Jewish citizens of Israel.<br/>
While administrative detention may be lawful in certain circumstances, Israel’s systematic use of it against&#160;<br/>Palestinians indicates that it is used to persecute Palestinians, rather than as an extraordinary and selective&#160;<br/>security measure. Consequently, Amnesty International has considered many administrative detainees to be&#160;<br/>prisoners of conscience detained as punishment for their views challenging the policies of the occupation.&#160;<br/>
Also, for decades, the Israel Security Agency, Israel Prison Service and Israeli military forces have tortured&#160;<br/>or otherwise ill-treated Palestinian detainees, including children, during arrest, transfer and interrogation.&#160;<br/>The Israel Security Agency uses particularly harsh methods to obtain information and “confessions”. Among&#160;<br/>the methods regularly reported by Palestinian detainees are painful shackling and binding, immobilization&#160;<br/>in stress positions, sleep deprivation, threats, sexual harassment, prolonged&#160;solitary confinement and verbal&#160;<br/>abuse.<br/>
Israeli courts have admitted evidence obtained through torture of Palestinians, accepting the justification&#160;<br/>of “necessity”. Prompt, thorough and impartial investigations by Israeli authorities into allegations by&#160;<br/>Palestinians that they have been tortured are extremely rare, effectively giving state endorsement to the&#160;<br/>crime of torture.<br/>
Israel’s widespread and systematic use of arbitrary arrest, administrative detention and torture on a large&#160;<br/>scale against Palestinians, in flagrant violation of fundamental rules and&#160;peremptory norms of international&#160;<br/>law, forms part of the state’s policy of domination and control over the Palestinian population. It forms part of&#160;<br/>the state’s widespread as well as systematic attack on the Palestinian population and constitutes the crimes&#160;<br/>against humanity of “imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty” and “torture” under the&#160;<br/>Rome Statute and the Apartheid Convention.<br/>
<b>UNLAWFUL KILLINGS AND SERIOUS INJURIES<br/></b>Israeli forces have killed and injured thousands of Palestinian civilians in the OPT since 1967, often in&#160;<br/>circumstances suggesting that the killings were systematic, unlawful and arbitrary, and with near total&#160;<br/>impunity. Such killings and injuries were perpetrated outside the context of armed conflict during Israeli law&#160;<br/>enforcement activities in the OPT, including during the suppression of protests, arrest raids, when enforcing&#160;<br/>travel and movement restrictions, and conducting house and search operations.&#160;<br/>
<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
31<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>In some cases, Israeli forces appear to have deliberately targeted medics, journalists and human rights&#160;<br/>defenders during protests.<br/>
Despite ample evidence of unlawful killings, Amnesty International is not aware of any case in which a&#160;<br/>member of any Israeli security force has been convicted of wilfully causing the death of a Palestinian in&#160;<br/>the OPT since 1987. In general, prosecutions have been extremely rare. When convictions have occurred,&#160;<br/>soldiers have been convicted of manslaughter or lesser offences.<br/>
There is also a pattern of Israeli forces and security agents killing Palestinian citizens of Israel, including in&#160;<br/>the context of protests against discriminatory Israeli policies and actions, in circumstances that indicate that&#160;<br/>the killings were unlawful.&#160;<br/>
Patterns of excessive use of force against Palestinians during law enforcement operations, information&#160;<br/>available about the Israeli military’s “rules of engagement”, as well as&#160;Israeli officials’ statements following&#160;<br/>such operations particularly during protests, reflect a planned and persistent policy of shooting to kill or&#160;<br/>maim Palestinians. They are consistent with the inhuman and inhumane acts of “murder” and “other&#160;<br/>inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to&#160;<br/>mental or physical health” or the “infliction upon the members of a&#160;racial group or groups of serious bodily&#160;<br/>or mental harm” under the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.<br/>
<b>DENIAL OF BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND PERSECUTION<br/></b>Israel’s systematic denial of the right to a nationality and severe restrictions on movement and residence,&#160;<br/>including the right to leave and to return to their country, go beyond&#160;what is justifiable under international&#160;<br/>law. Their sweeping application has targeted the Palestinian population in a discriminatory manner on the&#160;<br/>basis of their racialized identity as Palestinians, affecting their participation in political, social, economic&#160;<br/>and cultural life in Israel and the OPT and deliberately prevent their full development as a group. These&#160;<br/>restrictions further undermine the enjoyment of a host of basic rights and freedoms, including the rights to&#160;<br/>freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, livelihood, work, health,&#160;<br/>food and education.&#160;<br/>
By denying the Palestinian population basic human rights through years of deliberate discriminatory and&#160;<br/>exclusionary policies and official statements that are reflected in practice, Israeli authorities have committed&#160;<br/>the crime against humanity of, or other inhumane act similar to, “persecution” within the meaning of the&#160;<br/>Rome Statute and “denial of basic human rights” that “prevent the racial group or groups from participation&#160;<br/>in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions&#160;<br/>preventing [its or their] full development” under the Apartheid Convention.&#160;<br/>
<b>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND INTENT TO OPPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
<b>AND DOMINATE<br/></b>Israel has an obligation under international law to protect all persons within its jurisdiction and control&#160;<br/>from violence. In the context of an international armed conflict and a&#160;military occupation there may be&#160;<br/>circumstances where treating different groups differently is based on lawful grounds without infringing&#160;<br/>the prohibition of discrimination. While legitimate security concerns may allow differential treatment of&#160;<br/>Palestinians, security-related policies must comply with international law, and ensure that any restrictions on&#160;<br/>rights are necessary and proportionate to the security threat.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has shown, however, that Israeli authorities have pursued policies that deliberately&#160;<br/>discriminate against Palestinians over a prolonged period and in a particularly cruel manner in ways that&#160;<br/>have no reasonable basis in security or “defence”. For example, the prolonged and cruel discriminatory&#160;<br/>

32<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a>denial of Palestinians’ access to their land and property that was seized in a violent and discriminatory&#160;<br/>manner has no security rationale. There is no security basis for the effective segregation of Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizens of Israel through discriminatory laws on planning and access to housing or the denial of their&#160;<br/>right to claim their property and homes seized under the authority of racist laws. Similarly, arbitrary and&#160;<br/>discriminatory interference with the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to marry and extend rights of&#160;<br/>residence to their spouses and children, in the absence of evidence that particular individuals pose a threat,&#160;<br/>cannot be justified based on security.&#160;<br/>
In the context of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, certain limitations on human&#160;<br/>rights may be permissible under international humanitarian law if conducted in good faith. However, the&#160;<br/>justification for the differential treatment cannot extend to the settlement of Jewish Israelis in the occupied&#160;<br/>territories. Nor can it extend to the murders, the targeted killings, the torture, the deportation and forcible&#160;<br/>transfers of populations that have been perpetrated in the OPT over the years.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has demonstrated that other policies that Israel&#160;has justified on security grounds have&#160;<br/>been consistently implemented in a grossly disproportionate and discriminatory manner, resulting in mass,&#160;<br/>systematic violations of Palestinians’ human rights. These include Israel’s policies of sweeping, severe and&#160;<br/>long-term restrictions on freedom of movement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.&#160;<br/>
<b>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/></b>The totality of the regime of laws, policies and practices described by Amnesty International demonstrates&#160;<br/>that Israel has established and maintained an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the&#160;<br/>Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis – a system of&#160;apartheid – wherever it has exercised&#160;<br/>control over Palestinians’ lives since 1948. Amnesty International concludes that the State of Israel considers&#160;<br/>and treats Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group. The segregation is conducted in a systematic&#160;<br/>and highly institutionalized manner through laws, policies and practices, all of which are intended to&#160;<br/>prevent Palestinians from claiming and enjoying equal rights to Jewish Israelis within the territory of Israel&#160;<br/>and within the OPT, and thus are intended to oppress and dominate the Palestinian people. This has been&#160;<br/>complemented by a legal regime that controls (by negating) the rights of Palestinian refugees residing&#160;<br/>outside Israel and the OPT to return to their homes.<br/>
Dismantling this cruel system of apartheid is essential for the millions of Palestinians who continue to live in&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT, as well as for the return of Palestinian refugees who remain displaced in neighbouring&#160;<br/>countries, often within 100km of their original homes, so that they can enjoy their human rights free from&#160;<br/>discrimination. Among other, more specific, recommendations, Amnesty International is&#160;calling on Israel to&#160;<br/>remove all measures of discrimination, segregation and oppression currently in place against the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population and to undertake a review of all laws, regulations, policies and practices that discriminate on&#160;<br/>racial, ethnic or religious grounds with a view to repealing or amending them in line with international human&#160;<br/>rights law and standards.&#160;<br/>
Israel must grant equal and full human rights to all Palestinians in Israel and the OPT in line with principles&#160;<br/>of international human rights law and without discrimination, while ensuring respect for protections&#160;<br/>guaranteed for Palestinians in the OPT under international humanitarian law. It must also recognize the right&#160;<br/>of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to homes where they or their families once lived in&#160;<br/>Israel or the OPT. In addition, Israel must provide victims of human rights violations, crimes against humanity&#160;<br/>and serious violations of international humanitarian law – and their families – with full reparations. These&#160;<br/>should include restitution of and compensation for all properties acquired on a racial basis.<br/>
The scale and seriousness of the violations documented in this report make it clear that the international&#160;<br/>community needs to urgently and drastically change its approach to&#160;the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and&#160;<br/>recognize the full extent of the crimes that Israel perpetrates against the Palestinian people. Indeed, for over&#160;<br/>seven decades, the international community has stood by as Israel has been given free rein to dispossess,&#160;<br/>

<a name=34></a>segregate, control, oppress and dominate Palestinians. The numerous UN Security Council resolutions&#160;<br/>adopted over the years have remained unimplemented with Israel facing no repercussions for actions that&#160;<br/>have violated international law apart from formulaic condemnations. Meanwhile, addressing Israeli violations&#160;<br/>against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip merely within the framework of international&#160;<br/>humanitarian law, and separately from the violations perpetrated against Palestinians in Israel, has failed to&#160;<br/>tackle the root causes of the conflict and achieve any form of accountability and justice for the victims.&#160;<br/>
Without taking any meaningful action to hold Israel to account for its systematic and widespread violations&#160;<br/>and crimes under international law against the Palestinian population, the international community has&#160;<br/>contributed to undermining the international legal order and has emboldened Israel to continue perpetrating&#160;<br/>crimes with impunity. In fact, some states have actively supported Israel’s violations by supplying it with&#160;<br/>arms, equipment and other tools to perpetrate crimes under international law and by providing diplomatic&#160;<br/>cover, including at the UN Security Council, to shield it from accountability. By doing so, they have&#160;<br/>completely failed the Palestinian people and have only exacerbated Palestinians’ lived experience as people&#160;<br/>with lesser rights and inferior status to Jewish Israelis.&#160;<br/>
While ultimately change can only come from within Israel, the international community can take concrete&#160;<br/>actions to pressure Israel into dismantling its apartheid system. The crime against humanity of apartheid&#160;<br/>entails individual international criminal responsibility, which applies to individuals, members of organizations&#160;<br/>and representatives of the state who participate in its commission. Thus, Israel itself, the Palestinian&#160;<br/>authorities, the international community and the International Criminal Court (ICC) should all investigate the&#160;<br/>commission of the crime of apartheid under international law.&#160;<br/>
All states may exercise universal jurisdiction over all persons reasonably suspected of committing the crime&#160;<br/>of apartheid, while states that are party to the Apartheid Convention have an obligation to do so including to&#160;<br/>prosecute, bring to trial and punish those persons responsible for the crime. This means that states must&#160;<br/>conduct prompt, effective and impartial criminal investigations when presented with reasonable evidence&#160;<br/>that an individual within their territory or control is reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility or extradite&#160;<br/>suspects to another jurisdiction that will do so.&#160;<br/>
Nearly six years after the ICC Prosecutor announced the opening of a preliminary examination into the&#160;<br/>“Situation in Palestine”, in February 2021, the Pre-Trial Chamber concluded that the “Court’s territorial&#160;<br/>jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza&#160;<br/>and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” paving the way for investigation into crimes committed in&#160;<br/>the OPT since 13 June 2014. On 3 March 2021, the Prosecutor announced&#160;that her office was proceeding&#160;<br/>to open an investigation into Rome Statute crimes committed in the OPT. Amnesty International is therefore&#160;<br/>calling on the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC to consider the applicability of the crime against humanity&#160;<br/>of apartheid within its current formal investigation.<br/>
While the ICC has held that it has jurisdiction over Rome Statute crimes committed in the OPT, it does not&#160;<br/>have jurisdiction over crimes committed within Israel itself. The UN Security Council must therefore ensure&#160;<br/>that perpetrators of the crime against humanity of apartheid and other crimes under international law in&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT are brought to justice either by referring the entire situation to the ICC or by establishing&#160;<br/>an international tribunal to try alleged perpetrators. The UN Security Council must also impose targeted&#160;<br/>sanctions, such as asset freezes, against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid, and a&#160;<br/>comprehensive arms embargo on Israel.&#160;<br/>
At the same time, the UN General Assembly should re-establish the Special Committee against Apartheid,&#160;<br/>which was originally established in November 1962, to focus on all situations, including Israel and the OPT,&#160;<br/>where the serious human rights violation and crime against humanity of apartheid are being committed and&#160;<br/>to bring pressure on those responsible to disestablish these systems of oppression and domination.<br/>
All governments and regional actors, particularly those that enjoy close diplomatic relations with Israel such&#160;<br/>as the USA, the European Union and its member states and the UK, but also those states that are in the&#160;<br/>process of strengthening their ties – such as some Arab and African states – must not support the system&#160;<br/>

<a name=35></a>of apartheid or render aid or assistance to maintaining such a regime, and cooperate to bring an end to this&#160;<br/>unlawful situation. As a first step, they must recognize that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid and&#160;<br/>other international crimes, and use all political and diplomatic tools to ensure Israeli authorities implement&#160;<br/>the recommendations outlined in this report and review any cooperation and activities with Israel to ensure&#160;<br/>that these do not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid. Amnesty International is also reiterating&#160;<br/>its long-standing call on states to immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer of all&#160;<br/>weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the provision of training and other&#160;<br/>military and security assistance. Finally, it is calling on states to institute and enforce a ban on products from&#160;<br/>Israeli settlements.<br/>
The Palestinian authorities for their part must also ensure that any type of dealings with Israel, primarily&#160;<br/>through security coordination, do not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid against Palestinians&#160;<br/>in the OPT, and should document as necessary and in line with international standards the discriminatory&#160;<br/>impacts of Israel’s apartheid on the Palestinian population in the OPT to provide evidence of such impact to&#160;<br/>relevant international courts and other bodies.<br/>
Businesses too, have a responsibility to assess their activities in Israel and the OPT and ensure that they&#160;<br/>do not contribute to or benefit from the system of apartheid, and address such impact when it occurs and&#160;<br/>cease relevant activities if it cannot be prevented. Finally, national and international humanitarian and&#160;<br/>development organizations must increase advocacy, both public and private, with the Israeli government to&#160;<br/>end discrimination and segregation in law, policy and practices against Palestinians in Israel and the OPT,&#160;<br/>including through advocacy with donors, and conduct rigorous and ongoing assessments of all projects&#160;<br/>and assistance for Palestinians to ensure they are implemented in a way that does not entrench, support or&#160;<br/>perpetuate discrimination and segregation of Palestinians.<br/>

<a name=36></a><b>2. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY&#160;</b><br/>
<b>2.1 SCOPE<br/></b>This report documents and analyses Israel’s institutionalized and systematic discrimination against&#160;<br/>Palestinians. It focuses on the main and foundational elements of Israel’s discrimination against Palestinians&#160;<br/>in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and against Palestinian refugees who are outside&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT. The report examines Israeli legislation, policies and practices that affect Palestinians in&#160;<br/>all areas under its jurisdiction and effective control (Israel and the OPT), or where their rights are effectively&#160;<br/>controlled by Israel.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International researched and compiled this report within the framework of the definition of&#160;<br/>apartheid under international law, to determine whether discriminatory and exclusionary Israeli law, policies&#160;<br/>and practices against Palestinians amount to apartheid as a violation of public international law, a serious&#160;<br/>human rights violation and a crime against humanity.<br/>
This report is not comprehensive and should not be read as an exhaustive analysis of all forms of&#160;<br/>discrimination experienced by Palestinians within Israel and the OPT (or indeed of all forms of discrimination&#160;<br/>committed within Israel and the OPT). Amnesty International has documented serious violations of human&#160;<br/>rights committed by Israel against Palestinians in both Israel and the OPT, and raised concerns about the&#160;<br/>consequences of such violations for Palestinians, since the 1960s. The organization has also documented&#160;<br/>violations committed by Palestinian authorities or armed groups against Palestinians and Israelis, which are&#160;<br/>not the focus of this report.1<br/>
Similarly, this report does not imply that discrimination exclusively affects Palestinians in Israel and the OPT.&#160;<br/>It does not focus on discrimination experienced by other minority groups, such as the Druze and Circassians,&#160;<br/>but it refers to some of the policies that affect the enjoyment of their rights in Israel.&#160;<br/>
The geographical scope of this report is limited to Israel and the OPT. The report does examine Israeli laws,&#160;<br/>policies and practices that affect the rights of Palestinian refugees outside Israel and the OPT by denying&#160;<br/>them the right to nationality and residency in their homes in Israel and the OPT, and how this denial affects&#160;<br/>Palestinians living within Israel and the OPT. However, it does not address the situation of Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees in their host countries, which Amnesty International has researched and reported on elsewhere.2&#160;&#160;<br/>

<a name=37></a>The report also does not address human rights violations or Israeli discriminatory policies against Syrians in&#160;<br/>the occupied Golan Heights.3&#160;<br/>
The framework of apartheid, recognized under international law as a violation of public international law,&#160;<br/>a serious human rights violation and a crime against humanity, allows a comprehensive understanding,&#160;<br/>grounded in international law, of a situation of segregation, oppression and domination by one racial group&#160;<br/>over another. Amnesty International notes and clarifies that systems of oppression and domination will never&#160;<br/>be identical. Therefore, this report does not seek to argue that, or assess whether, any system of oppression&#160;<br/>and domination as perpetrated in Israel and the OPT is, for instance, the same or analogous to the system&#160;<br/>of segregation, oppression and domination as perpetrated in South Africa between 1948 and 1994. Instead,&#160;<br/>this report analyses the systematic discrimination currently perpetrated by Israel against Palestinians and&#160;<br/>determines whether it meets the international definition of apartheid&#160;as set out by international law and&#160;<br/>treaties, as a violation of public international law, a serious human rights violation and a crime against&#160;<br/>humanity.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has reached a general conclusion on the perpetration of the crime against humanity of&#160;<br/>apartheid rather than seeking to establish individual criminal responsibility. Establishing such responsibility&#160;<br/>would be the task of domestic or international courts, which in doing so must strictly apply international&#160;<br/>standards of fairness. The report thus identifies and allows engagement&#160;with the systematic nature of&#160;<br/>violations and provides a way forward towards accountability and enjoyment of rights by all.<br/>
Amnesty International’s examination of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as potentially a system of apartheid&#160;<br/>builds on the growing body of work by human rights groups, legal practitioners, writers and academics.&#160;<br/>Palestinians have been advocating for an understanding of Israel’s rule as apartheid for over two decades.&#160;<br/>Dismantling Israel’s apartheid was central to the call from Palestinian civil society that established the&#160;<br/>Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in 2005. Palestinian human rights organizations, including&#160;<br/>members of the Palestinian Human Rights Organizations Council, have significantly contributed to the&#160;<br/>documentation and analysis of the system and crime of apartheid and have been at the forefront of&#160;<br/>advocacy in that regard at the UN. UN Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in the OPT&#160;<br/>have published reports concluding that Israel has committed acts potentially amounting to apartheid and&#160;<br/>recommending that the UN General Assembly request the International Court of Justice to assess this&#160;<br/>further. In 2017, the UN’s Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), published a report,&#160;<br/>which was later withdrawn from its website, stating that Israel had “established an apartheid regime that&#160;<br/>dominates the Palestinian people as a whole”.&#160;<br/>
More recently, the Israeli human rights organizations Yesh Din and B’Tselem (Israeli Information Center on&#160;<br/>Human Rights in the Occupied Territories) as well as Human Rights Watch have also examined the situation&#160;<br/>and concluded that apartheid is practised in part of or in the whole of the territory under the effective control&#160;<br/>of the State of Israel.&#160;<br/>
Over the years, this research coupled with grassroots campaigning has contributed to a broader international&#160;<br/>recognition of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid by activist groups, civil society organizations&#160;<br/>and media outlets, including some mainstream ones. Yet states, particularly Israel’s Western allies, have&#160;<br/>been reluctant to do the same, and have refused to take any meaningful action against Israel despite the&#160;<br/>overwhelming evidence. Further, while some diplomats have confidentially recognized Israel’s rule over&#160;<br/>Palestinians as apartheid, they have in most cases limited their analysis to Israel’s conduct in the OPT.&#160;<br/>Meanwhile, Palestinian organizations and human rights defenders who have been leading anti-apartheid&#160;<br/>advocacy and campaigning efforts have faced Israeli repression for years as punishment for their work.

from the Golan Heights as a result of the war and the occupation. Israel destroyed more than 100 villages and most of the land&#160;was used&#160;<br/>
to establish illegal Israeli settlements. In 1981, Israel adopted the Golan Heights Law, which extends Israeli jurisdiction and law to the&#160;<br/>
occupied Golan Heights. The international community has condemned this “annexation” and the Golan Heights is acknowledged to&#160;be&#160;<br/>
occupied territory where international humanitarian law is applicable, with Israel recognized as the occupying power with responsibilities&#160;<br/>
towards the Syrian population outlined under international humanitarian law and international human rights law.<br/>

<a name=38></a>October 2021, the Israeli authorities escalated their attacks on the Palestinian human rights movement&#160;<br/>even further by designating six prominent civil society organizations as “terrorist organizations”, allowing the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities to shut down their offices, seize their assets and detain and prosecute their employees, in&#160;<br/>addition to prohibiting funding or even the public expression of support for their activities. In parallel, Israel&#160;<br/>has subjected Israeli organizations denouncing apartheid to smears and delegitimization campaigns.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International publishes this report with a view to supporting Palestinian civil society and Israeli&#160;<br/>organizations in their efforts to end Israel’s oppression and domination over Palestinians. By doing so, it also&#160;<br/>hopes to contribute to a greater understanding and recognition of institutionalized discrimination committed&#160;<br/>in Israel and the OPT and against Palestinian refugees as a system and crime of apartheid.&#160;<br/>
The body of work developed by Palestinian and other human rights organizations provides a spectrum&#160;<br/>of analysis and focuses within the legal framework of apartheid. Amnesty International recognizes that&#160;<br/>different legal and administrative regimes govern Palestinians across the different territorial domains&#160;<br/>where they live: Israel, annexed East Jerusalem, the rest of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip,&#160;<br/>and outside Israel and the OPT. Consequently, the organization also acknowledges that Israel’s system&#160;<br/>of oppression and domination over Palestinians has evolved over time, and currently manifests itself&#160;<br/>differently and with different levels of severity across the distinct domains. However, given that territorial&#160;<br/>and legal fragmentation and segregation are key elements through which Israel enforces its oppression&#160;<br/>and domination over Palestinians, Amnesty International believes that the full extent of Israel’s control over&#160;<br/>Palestinians is only evident when the whole context of the state’s control over Palestinians in all domains is&#160;<br/>taken into consideration. Therefore, instead of assessing separately whether or not Israel has perpetrated&#160;<br/>the international wrong and the crime against humanity in each of the territories under its control, Amnesty&#160;<br/>International has analysed the system of institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians as a whole.&#160;<br/>It has reached its conclusions through legal interpretation that the system and crime of apartheid is best&#160;<br/>understood holistically as the intentional, prolonged and cruel control of one racial group by another.&#160;<br/>
While recognizing the potential validity of the arguments made by some Palestinian human rights groups and&#160;<br/>others that apply the right to self-determination as the framework of analysis for the situation in Israel and&#160;<br/>the OPT, Amnesty International limits its analysis to legal frameworks that explicitly address institutionalized&#160;<br/>racial discrimination. This is because, while the organization recognizes that both the Jewish and the&#160;<br/>Palestinian peoples claim the right to self-determination, Amnesty International does not take a position&#160;<br/>on international political or legal arrangements that might be adopted to implement that right. Instead, the&#160;<br/>organization engages with the reality of the existence of the State of Israel, as well as the mandate for its&#160;<br/>creation in UN General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) of 1947, and the fact that, subsequent to 1967, Israel&#160;<br/>has exercised effective control over the whole territory of British mandate Palestine.4&#160;It considers that the&#160;<br/>State of Israel has obligations under international law, including through obligations expressed in General&#160;<br/>Assembly Resolution 181 (II), to ensure the right to equality and non-discrimination. Similarly, it considers&#160;<br/>that Israel is prohibited by conventional and customary international law from establishing a system of&#160;<br/>institutional discrimination against the Palestinian people, from denying Palestinians equal rights with Jewish&#160;<br/>Israelis, and from establishing an oppressive system of domination.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International examines in this report whether the State of Israel, and public officials acting on&#160;<br/>its behalf, have created and maintained a system of oppression and domination that has included ethnic&#160;<br/>cleansing, fragmentation and dispossession of the Palestinian inhabitants of the land that made up British&#160;<br/>mandate Palestine prior to 1948.<br/>
4.&#160;&#160;Following the end of the First World War, under a League of Nations mandate from 1922 to 1947, Britain ruled over Palestine, a&#160;<br/>
territory formerly under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations provided the&#160;legal obligations&#160;<br/>
of Britain, as the Mandatory Power of Palestine, to provide “administrative advice and assistance” to the local population “until such time&#160;<br/>
as they are able to stand alone”. League of Nations, General Assembly, “Question of Palestine - Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of&#160;<br/>

<a name=39></a><b>2.2 METHODOLOGY<br/></b>This report builds on decades of Amnesty International desk and field&#160;research collecting testimonies and&#160;<br/>evidence of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Israel and the OPT, and on&#160;<br/>publications by Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights and humanitarian organizations in addition&#160;<br/>to academic studies, monitoring by grassroots activist groups, reports by UN agencies, experts and human&#160;<br/>rights bodies, and media articles.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International carried out research and analysis for this report between July 2017 and November&#160;<br/>2021. The research and analysis were guided by a global policy on the human rights violation and crime of&#160;<br/>apartheid that Amnesty International adopted in July 2017, following recognition that the organization had&#160;<br/>given insufficient attention to situations of systematic discrimination&#160;and oppression around the world. This&#160;<br/>report follows similar research and analysis conducted on the situation in Myanmar.5<br/>
Amnesty International extensively analysed relevant Israeli legislation, regulations, military orders, directives&#160;<br/>by government institutions and statements by Israeli government and&#160;military officials. It reviewed other&#160;<br/>Israeli government documents, such as planning and zoning documents and plans, budgets and statistics,&#160;<br/>Israeli parliamentary archives and Israeli court judgments. It also reviewed relevant reports and statistics&#160;<br/>published by Palestinian authorities.&#160;<br/>
As part of its research, Amnesty International spoke with representatives of Palestinian, Israeli and&#160;<br/>international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), relevant UN agencies, legal practitioners, scholars and&#160;<br/>academics, journalists, and other relevant stakeholders. In addition, it conducted extensive legal analysis on&#160;<br/>the situation, including engaging with and seeking advice from external experts on international law.&#160;<br/>
To illustrate the interplay between various long-standing discriminatory laws, policies and practices that&#160;<br/>constitute the foundational elements of Israel’s system of oppression and domination, and their devastating&#160;<br/>impact on the human rights of Palestinians across Israel and the OPT, the report contains 34 emblematic&#160;<br/>case studies. Many of these case studies have been the focus of Amnesty International’s human rights&#160;<br/>monitoring and campaigns in Israel and the OPT for years and include evidence compiled by different teams&#160;<br/>of researchers over time. To complement long-standing concerns and analyse them through the framework&#160;<br/>of apartheid, between February 2020 and July 2021, Amnesty International representatives interviewed 56&#160;<br/>people in areas that are the focus of these case studies.&#160;<br/>
For safety reasons and because of Covid-19 movement restrictions on access, most of these interviews were&#160;<br/>conducted remotely. All interviews with Palestinians residing in the Gaza Strip were carried out remotely,&#160;<br/>given Israel’s refusal to grant Amnesty International access since 2012. Some people were interviewed several&#160;<br/>times and remained in close contact with Amnesty International until the time of publication. The report also&#160;<br/>makes use of interviews carried out in the context of relevant work prior to February 2020. Wherever possible,&#160;<br/>Amnesty International corroborated information collected through interviews by reviewing photographic and&#160;<br/>video evidence and other relevant documentation, such as court&#160;documents, all of which are on file.&#160;<br/>
All interviewees were informed about the nature and purpose of the research as well as how the information&#160;<br/>they provided would be used. Oral consent was obtained from each interviewee prior to the start of the&#160;<br/>interview and confirmed again at the end of the interview. No incentives were provided to interviewees in&#160;<br/>exchange for their accounts. Some interviewees requested that their names not be published for security&#160;<br/>reasons; their names and information that could identify them have been withheld in this report.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International completed the majority of its research for this report in August 2021. Consequently,&#160;<br/>details of patterns of violations and case studies are updated to the end of that month, but not beyond. This&#160;<br/>is clarified in references in footnotes. The report does, however, address major relevant developments in&#160;<br/>Israeli legislation and government policy in September and October 2021.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=41></a><b>3. TIMELINE &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
The following, by no means comprehensive, set of developments in the history of Palestine and Israel&#160;<br/>are pertinent to understanding the issues covered by Amnesty International’s report.&#160;<br/>
Following the defeat of the Ottoman empire in the First World War, in&#160;<b>1922</b>&#160;the League of Nations&#160;<br/>placed Palestine under a British mandate, which lasted until 1947. The area of mandate Palestine&#160;<br/>covered what is now Israel and the OPT.<br/>
In&#160;<b>1947</b>, the UN recommended partition of Palestine into a Jewish state (comprising 55% of the&#160;<br/>territory) and an Arab state (45%), with international control over Jerusalem and its environs. At that&#160;<br/>time, Jews comprised around 30% of the population and Palestinians around 70%. The Palestinian&#160;<br/>leadership at the time, as well as Arab states, rejected the UN partition plan.&#160;<br/>
In the&#160;<b>1947-49</b>&#160;conflict before and after the&#160;<b>May 1948</b>&#160;declaration of the State of Israel, thousands&#160;<br/>of Palestinians and Jews were killed and more than 800,000 Palestinians were displaced from their&#160;<br/>homes in the context of attacks on civilians. This experience is known as the&#160;<i>nakba</i>&#160;(catastrophe)&#160;<br/>by Palestinians. Some were internally displaced from their villages and cities to other parts of what&#160;<br/>became Israel. Others fled to different parts of mandate Palestine (22% of which fell under the control&#160;<br/>of Jordan and Egypt following the conflict). Most of the rest&#160;fled to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.&#160;<br/>
Since then, Israel has prevented the Palestinian refugees and their descendants, as well as internally&#160;<br/>displaced persons within Israel, from returning to their homes.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians who remained in Israel – around 150,000 people – became entitled to Israeli citizenship.&#160;<br/>However,&#160;<b>from 1948 to 1966</b>&#160;they were placed under military rule. Meanwhile,&#160;<b>between 1949 and&#160;<br/>1952</b>&#160;the Jewish population more than doubled, mainly through immigration.<br/>
After the establishment of Israel, two parts of mandate Palestine remained outside its control: the Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip, which was administered by Egypt; and the eastern area, which became known as the West Bank&#160;<br/>and was administered by Jordan.<br/>
The Arab-Israel war in&#160;<b>1967</b>, which Israel won in six days, led to Israel militarily occupying the West&#160;<br/>Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Together, these areas are known as the OPT.&#160;<br/>The war also resulted in the displacement of a further 350,000 refugees, the vast majority of them&#160;<br/>Palestinians from the OPT, mainly to Jordan. Israel also prevents these Palestinian refugees and their&#160;<br/>descendants from returning.<br/>
In&#160;<b>1980</b>, Israel unilaterally (and unlawfully under international law) formalized its 1967 annexation&#160;<br/>of East Jerusalem, including Palestinian parts of the city and a surrounding area of about 70km2&#160;that&#160;<br/>belonged to about 28 Palestinian villages.<br/>
The first&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;(uprising) by Palestinians against Israel’s occupation began in&#160;<b>December 1987</b>&#160;<br/>and ended in 1993 with the signing of the first Oslo Accords. Between&#160;<b>1993 and 1995,</b>&#160;further&#160;<br/>negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led to more Oslo Accords.&#160;<br/>These established the Palestinian Authority and tasked it with limited self-governance of the Gaza Strip&#160;<br/>

<a name=42></a>and parts of the West Bank and divided the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem and Hebron) into&#160;<br/>Areas A, B and C. The establishment of the Palestinian Authority did not change the status of the OPT&#160;<br/>under international law as territories under Israeli military occupation.<br/>
The Palestinian authorities have varying degrees of administrative responsibility over Areas A and&#160;<br/>B, where some 90% of Palestinians live (around 2.8 million people). Israel has full civil and security&#160;<br/>authority over Area C, Palestinian rural areas that comprise about 60% of the West Bank and are home&#160;<br/>to around 300,000 Palestinians.&#160;<br/>
In&#160;<b>September 2000</b>&#160;Palestinians launched a second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;against Israel’s military rule in the West&#160;<br/>Bank and Gaza Strip. During the uprising, which ended in 2005, Israeli forces killed Palestinians&#160;<br/>unlawfully by shooting them during protests and at checkpoints although they were not posing&#160;<br/>imminent danger. They also bombed residential areas and carried out extrajudicial executions.&#160;<br/>Palestinian armed groups and individuals deliberately killed Israeli civilians by placing bombs in&#160;<br/>crowded places and in drive-by shootings both in Israel and in the OPT. In response, the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities collectively punished the OPT’s entire population by imposing severe restrictions on&#160;<br/>movement and demolishing hundreds of Palestinian homes.<br/>
In&#160;<b>mid-2002</b>, Israel began constructing a fence/wall in and around the West Bank, mostly on&#160;<br/>Palestinian land. The route has meant further appropriation of Palestinian land and the separation and&#160;<br/>segregation of Palestinian communities. In 2004, the International Court of Justice advised that the&#160;<br/>barrier was illegal.<br/>
In&#160;<b>September 2005</b>, Israel “disengaged” from the Gaza Strip, withdrawing all military personnel and&#160;<br/>some 8,000 Jewish settlers from the territory while retaining control over its airspace, coastal waters&#160;<br/>and borders. Many settlers were moved to settlements in the West Bank.<br/>
In&#160;<b>2007</b>, armed clashes between security forces and armed groups loyal to the two main Palestinian&#160;<br/>political parties, Fatah and Hamas, culminated in Hamas seizing control of Palestinian government&#160;<br/>institutions in the Gaza Strip, and the ousting of forces loyal to Fatah. Since then, Hamas has acted as&#160;<br/>the de facto government of Gaza establishing a parallel security and law enforcement apparatus there,&#160;<br/>while Fatah remains the dominant party comprising the Palestinian authorities, including government&#160;<br/>and presidency, in the West Bank.<br/>
Meanwhile, Israel imposed an air, land and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip collectively punishing its&#160;<br/>entire population. Since then, Israel has severely restricted the entry of goods and fuel into Gaza, the&#160;<br/>export of produce from Gaza and the movement of people between Gaza and the West Bank.<br/>
In&#160;<b>December 2008, November 2012, July 2014</b>&#160;and&#160;<b>May 2021</b>, Israel launched military offensives&#160;<br/>against Gaza, while Palestinian armed groups fired rockets from&#160;the territory into Israel. These&#160;<br/>offensives have caused huge destruction to civilian property and infrastructure including electricity,&#160;<br/>water and sewerage networks and sanitation plants in Gaza in addition to killing at least 2,700&#160;<br/>Palestinian civilians as well as injuring and displacing hundreds of thousands of others. During this&#160;<br/>period Palestinian armed groups fired thousands of indiscriminate rockets towards cities and towns in&#160;<br/>Israel killing or injuring dozens of civilians.<br/>
Most recently, the outbreak of violence in&#160;<b>May 2021</b>&#160;occurred after threatened forced evictions of&#160;<br/>Palestinians in East Jerusalem prompted widespread protests.<br/>

<b>INTERNATIONAL&#160;LAW&#160;&#160;</b><br/>
<b>4.1 PROHIBITION AND CRIMINALIZATION OF APARTHEID<br/></b>Originally, “apartheid” referred to a political system formally introduced in South Africa in 1948 (building&#160;<br/>on existing racially discriminatory and segregationist laws and policies developed and applied under a&#160;<br/>system of minority white rule). The system was characterized by laws, policies and practices that ensured&#160;<br/>racial oppression and domination (which included formal racial segregation and discrimination) by one&#160;<br/>racial group (“white” South Africans) over others (especially, but not limited to, “black” South Africans).6&#160;&#160;<br/>Formal apartheid finally ended in South Africa in the mid-1990s. Similar&#160;systems, although not necessarily&#160;<br/>referred to as apartheid, were introduced and maintained in other countries of southern Africa until they&#160;<br/>were dismantled at the end of racist minority rule.7&#160;After its formal introduction in 1948 and especially in the&#160;<br/>1970s, the international community adopted the term “apartheid” to condemn such systems and practices&#160;<br/>of formalized racial oppression and domination.&#160;<br/>
The international community expressly prohibits apartheid in public international law,8&#160;international&#160;<br/>human rights law,9&#160;and international criminal law.10&#160;The totality of these condemnations, prohibitions and&#160;<br/>criminalization, including the criminalization in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)&#160;<br/>that occurred after apartheid in South Africa had ended, makes it clear that the international community&#160;<br/>
6.&#160;&#160;Such South African laws included, among many others, the Population Registration Act&#160;(1950), which classified citizens into racial&#160;<br/>
“population groups”; and the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act (1953), which allowed racial segregation of public amenities&#160;such as&#160;<br/>
premises, vehicles and services.<br/>
7.&#160;&#160;See especially Zimbabwe, which became independent in 1980, and Namibia, which became independent in 1990. Three other states&#160;<br/>
in the sub-region were formally protectorates of the UK and either practised some form of segregation and/or were dependent on&#160;links&#160;<br/>
with the South African economy and thus were subjected to apartheid policies: Botswana, which attained independence in 1964;&#160;Lesotho,&#160;<br/>
which attained independence in 1966; and Swaziland, which obtained independence in 1968. Forms of segregation and systematic&#160;<br/>
discrimination were also practised in Angola and Mozambique, which became independent in 1975.&#160;<br/>
8.&#160;&#160;The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held that apartheid constitutes a “flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of&#160;<br/>
the (UN) Charter”. See ICJ, Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa)&#160;<br/>
notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), advisory opinion, 21 June 1971. Dire Tladi, International Law Commission (ILC)&#160;<br/>
Special Rapporteur, has concluded that the prohibition of apartheid amounts to a peremptory norm of international law. See ILC,&#160;<i>Fourth&#160;</i><br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a>intended not only to condemn and criminalize apartheid as practised in southern Africa but wherever a&#160;<br/>system of oppression and domination based on race might be enforced.11<br/>
Currently, three main international treaties prohibit and/or explicitly criminalize apartheid: the International&#160;<br/>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD); the International Convention on&#160;<br/>the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (Apartheid Convention) and the Rome Statute of&#160;<br/>the ICC (Rome Statute).12<br/>
The 1965 ICERD, which has been ratified by 182 countries, was the&#160;first international human rights law&#160;<br/>instrument to proscribe and condemn apartheid. It provides in Article 3 that “States Parties particularly&#160;<br/>condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of&#160;<br/>this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.”13&#160;Since then, other international human rights law treaties&#160;<br/>have explicitly referenced the prohibition of the practice of apartheid.14&#160;&#160;<br/>
The ICERD places obligations on states parties to repeal and suppress laws, policies and practices that&#160;<br/>establish and perpetuate segregation and apartheid, not only in the territories over which they exercise&#160;<br/>sovereignty, but also in the territories beyond their borders over which they exercise effective control.15&#160;States&#160;<br/>have a duty to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of people&#160;under their jurisdiction, including people&#160;<br/>living in territory that is outside national borders but under their effective control.16&#160;As such, states parties&#160;<br/>are legally obliged not to engage in acts constituting the system of apartheid and to prevent, prohibit and&#160;<br/>punish such acts in all situations under their jurisdiction, including where the effect of their actions is felt&#160;<br/>extraterritorially.17&#160;Israel ratified the ICERD in 1979 and as a result its legal&#160;obligations under the convention&#160;<br/>

12.&#160;&#160;In addition, “practices of apartheid” are listed as grave breaches of international humanitarian law and war crimes. See, in particular,&#160;<br/>
Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&#160;<br/>

13.&#160;&#160;ICERD, adopted by UNGA Resolution 2106 (XX) on 21 December 1965, entered into force on 4 January 1969.<br/>
14.&#160;&#160;UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, adopted on 18 December 1979.<br/>
15.&#160;&#160;This was further upheld by the ICJ, which held that the government of South Africa had maintained “a policy of apartheid” while it&#160;<br/>
unlawfully administered and occupied Namibia, and was thus “accountable for any violations of its international obligations, or&#160;of the rights&#160;<br/>
of the people of Namibia.” The ICJ ruled that “Physical control of a territory, and not sovereignty or legitimacy of title, is&#160;the basis of State&#160;<br/>
liability for acts affecting other States”. ICJ, Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South&#160;<br/>
West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), advisory opinion, 21 June 1971, para. 118.<br/>
16.&#160;&#160;For example, the ICJ confirmed that Israel is obliged to extend to people in the OPT the&#160;application of the International Covenant on&#160;<br/>
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and other treaties to which&#160;<br/>
it is a state party. See ICJ, Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, advisory opinion, 9 July&#160;<br/>
2004, paras 110-113. See also UN Human Rights Committee (HRC), General Comment 31: The Nature of the General Legal Obligation&#160;<br/>

17.&#160;&#160;Jurisdiction must be interpreted broadly to cover all situations where the state controls the enjoyment of a protected right.&#160;The UN&#160;<br/>
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has called on states parties to take appropriate legislative or administrative&#160;<br/>
measures to prevent acts of transnational corporations registered in the state party that negatively impact on the enjoyment of&#160;rights&#160;<br/>
of indigenous peoples in territories outside that state party. See, for example, CERD, Concluding Observations: USA, 8 May&#160;2008, UN&#160;<br/>
Doc. CERD/C/USA/CO/6, para. 30; CERD, Concluding Observations: Norway, 2011, UN Doc. CERD/C/NOR/CO/19-20, para. 17. The&#160;<br/>
UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has also consistently indicated that states parties must refrain from&#160;<br/>
interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of the Covenant rights by persons outside their territories. See, for example, CESCR,&#160;<br/>
General Comment 24: State Obligations under the ICESCR in the Context of Business Activities, 10 August 2017, UN Doc. E/C.12/GC/24,&#160;<br/>
para. 29; CESCR, General Comment 15: The Right to Water, 20 January 2003, UN Doc. E/C.12/2002/11, para. 31. The HRC in its General&#160;<br/>
Comment 36 on the right to life interpreted the term “jurisdiction” in Article 2 of the ICCPR in functional terms, referring to the ability of&#160;<br/>
one state to affect the “enjoyment” of the right to life of a person living in another state: “[A] State party has an obligation to respect and to&#160;<br/>
ensure the rights under article 6 of all persons who are within its territory and all persons subject to its jurisdiction, that&#160;is, all persons over&#160;<br/>
whose enjoyment of the right to life it exercises power or effective control. This includes persons located outside any territory effectively&#160;<br/>
controlled by the State, whose right to life is nonetheless impacted by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable&#160;<br/>
manner.” HRC, General Comment 36, Article 6: Right to life, 3 September 2018, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/36, para. 63. In its analysis of the&#160;<br/>
meaning of the term “jurisdiction”, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights (IACtHR) made specific reference to Article 31(1) of the&#160;<br/>
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. According to the court, Article 1(1) “signifies that the State obligation to respect and to ensure&#160;<br/>
human rights applies to every person who is within the State’s territory or who is in any way subject to its authority, responsibility or control.”&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a>are applicable in both Israel and the OPT.18&#160;The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&#160;<br/>(CERD) has concluded that Israel has violated Article 3 of the ICERD, although it has not explicitly used&#160;<br/>the term “apartheid”, and called on Israel to eradicate all such policies and practices against non-Jewish&#160;<br/>communities and in particular “policies or practices that severely and disproportionately affect the&#160;<br/>Palestinian population” in Israel and the OPT.19<br/>
Further, the prohibition of apartheid under public international law and international human rights law forms&#160;<br/>part of customary international law.20&#160;The International Court of Justice has held that apartheid is&#160;a “flagrant&#160;<br/>violation of the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter”.21<br/>
The 1973 Apartheid Convention defines apartheid as a crime against&#160;humanity and obliges states parties to&#160;<br/>investigate and prosecute persons suspected of criminal responsibility for the crime.22&#160;There are currently&#160;<br/>109 states parties to the Apartheid Convention;23&#160;Israel is not a state party.<br/>
The Rome Statute of 1998, which also defines apartheid as a crime&#160;against humanity in Article 7(1)(j),&#160;<br/>requires the usual contextual elements of commission of the crime as part of a widespread or systematic&#160;<br/>attack directed against the civilian population, pursuant to a state or organizational policy. There are&#160;<br/>currently&#160;123&#160;states&#160;parties&#160;to&#160;the&#160;Rome&#160;Statute;&#160;Israel&#160;signed&#160;it&#160;in&#160;2000&#160;but&#160;withdrew&#160;its&#160;signature&#160;in&#160;2002.24&#160;<br/>In 2015, the State of Palestine became a state party to the Rome Statute and accepted the jurisdiction of&#160;<br/>the ICC over alleged crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, committed in the “occupied&#160;<br/>Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014”.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International considers that apartheid is a crime against humanity under customary international&#160;<br/>law.25&#160;The International Law Commission has concluded that the prohibition of crimes against humanity is a&#160;<br/>peremptory norm of international law, from which no deviation is permitted, that is, no state may withdraw&#160;<br/>from its obligation to respect them under any circumstances.26&#160;The definition of crimes against humanity&#160;<br/>
18.&#160;&#160;In its advisory opinion on the construction of a wall in the OPT, the ICJ held that human rights instruments to which Israel is a party are&#160;<br/>
applicable to the OPT. ICJ, Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, advisory opinion, 9 July&#160;<br/>
2004.&#160;<br/>

March 2012, UN Doc. A/67/18, paras 28(24) and 28(27).<br/>
20.&#160;&#160;This conclusion is based on a number of factors, including the wide ratification of treaties&#160;prohibiting apartheid (see above); the&#160;<br/>
condemnation and calls for eradication of apartheid practices in many UN Resolutions, for instance apartheid was deemed a crime against&#160;<br/>
humanity by UNGA Resolution 2202 A (XXI) of 16 December 1966 and by the UNSC (endorsing the above resolution) in Resolution&#160;<br/>
556 (1984) of 23 October 1984. It should also be remembered that apartheid is indisputably a form of racial discrimination,&#160;which itself&#160;<br/>
is prohibited under customary international law. For similar academic opinions on the status of apartheid in international law, see, for&#160;<br/>
instance, Walter Kälin and Jörg Künzli,&#160;<i>The Law of International Human Rights Protection</i>, 2009, p. 70; Carola Lingaas, “The Crime against&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=47></a>in the Rome Statute reflects to a large extent the rules of customary&#160;international law,27&#160;and the inclusion&#160;<br/>of apartheid within Article 7 of the Rome Statute suggests that the crime against humanity of apartheid is a&#160;<br/>crime under customary international law.28&#160;There is therefore strong evidence that the specific definition&#160;of&#160;<br/>apartheid as a crime against humanity in the Rome Statute reflects&#160;customary international law.29&#160;This report&#160;<br/>applies the definition of the crime against humanity of apartheid in the Rome Statute to reflect customary&#160;<br/>international law.&#160;<br/>
<b>4.1.1 DEFINITIONS OF APARTHEID UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW&#160;<br/></b>The starting point for a definition of apartheid must be that in Article&#160;II of the Apartheid Convention, the first&#160;<br/>international convention to explicitly define the crime under international&#160;law. It provides that:<br/>
<i>… the term “the crime of apartheid”, which shall include similar policies and practices of racial&#160;<br/>segregation and discrimination as practised in southern Africa, shall apply to the following&#160;<br/>inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one&#160;<br/>racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing&#160;<br/>them…30&#160;</i><br/>
Article II then lists specific inhuman acts that committed in this context amount to the crime under&#160;<br/>international law of apartheid, ranging from violent ones such as murder and torture to legislative,&#160;<br/>administrative and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participating in&#160;<br/>the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and deny them basic human rights and&#160;<br/>freedoms. The specific inhuman acts enumerated are:&#160;<br/>
<i>a.&#160;&#160;Denial to a member or members of a racial group or groups of the right to life and liberty of&#160;</i><br/>
<i>person:&#160;</i><br/>
<i>(i) By murder of members of a racial group or groups;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>(ii) By the infliction upon the members of a racial group or groups of serious bodily or mental&#160;<br/>harm, by the infringement of their freedom or dignity, or by subjecting them to torture or to&#160;<br/>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>(iii) By arbitrary arrest and illegal imprisonment of the members of a racial group or groups;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>b.&#160;&#160;Deliberate imposition on a racial group or groups of living conditions calculated to cause its&#160;</i><br/>
<i>or their physical destruction in whole or in part;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>c.&#160;&#160;Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups&#160;</i><br/>
<i>from participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the&#160;<br/>deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups,&#160;<br/>in particular by denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and&#160;<br/>freedoms, including the right to work, the right to form recognized trade unions, the right to&#160;<br/>education, the right to leave and to return to their country, the right to a nationality, the right&#160;<br/>to freedom of movement and residence, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and&#160;<br/>the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association;&#160;</i><br/>
27.&#160;&#160;The Rome Statute’s Article 7 definition of “crime against humanity” has been accepted&#160;by the 123 states parties to the Rome Statute&#160;<br/>
and is the basis of domestic criminalization of crimes against humanity in many states. This&#160;definition was adopted essentially verbatim by&#160;<br/>
the ILC in draft Article 3 of its “Text of the draft articles on crimes against humanity provisionally adopted by the Commission in 2015”. See&#160;<br/>
ILC,&#160;<i>Sixty-Seventh Session (4 May-5 June and 6 July-7 August 2015) Report</i>, 24 August 2015, UN Doc. A/70/10.&#160;<br/>
28.&#160;&#160;For other evidence that corroborates the rule under customary international law, the UNGA had already declared apartheid a crime&#160;<br/>
against humanity in 1968. See UNGA, Resolution 2396 (XXXIII), adopted on 2 December 1968, UN Doc. A/Res/2396. In addition,&#160;<br/>
“inhuman acts resulting from the policy of apartheid” are listed as a crime against humanity in Article I(b) of the Convention&#160;on the&#160;<br/>
Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, adopted by UNGA Resolution 2391 (XXIII) of 26&#160;<br/>
November 1968, entered into force on 11 November 1970.<br/>

<i>lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group or&#160;<br/>groups, the prohibition of mixed marriages among members of various racial groups, the&#160;<br/>expropriation of landed property belonging to a racial group or groups or to members thereof;&#160;</i><br/>

The Rome Statute provides that the crime against humanity of apartheid is committed when&#160;<br/>“inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1”31&#160;are committed “in the&#160;<br/>context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group&#160;<br/>over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”.32&#160;&#160;<br/>The “special intent” element of the crime of apartheid under the Rome Statute that distinguishes it&#160;<br/>from other crimes against humanity is thus the maintenance of a regime of systematic oppression and&#160;<br/>domination.<br/>
There are two main differences between the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. First,&#160;<br/>the Rome Statute explicitly requires the existence of “an institutionalized regime of systematic&#160;<br/>oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and&#160;<br/>committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.”33&#160;While the Apartheid Convention does&#160;<br/>not expressly use the term “institutionalized regime” in the manner in which the Rome Statute&#160;<br/>does, a similar requirement can be gleaned from its definition of apartheid. Among other things,&#160;<br/>the convention describes the crime of apartheid as including “similar policies and practices&#160;<br/>of racial segregation and discrimination as practised in southern Africa,”34&#160;which indisputably&#160;<br/>involved institutionalized racial oppression and domination. The definition also specifically includes&#160;<br/>“legislative measures”,35&#160;clearly an “institutionalized” measure, among the “inhuman acts”&#160;<br/>constituting offences of apartheid.36&#160;Thus, for the proscribed acts listed under both the Apartheid&#160;<br/>Convention and the Rome Statute to amount to the crime of apartheid, they must be committed to&#160;<br/>(create or) maintain an “institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one&#160;<br/>racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining&#160;<br/>that regime”.&#160;<br/>
In this regard it can be noted that the Apartheid Convention focuses more on the “purpose” to create&#160;<br/>or maintain such domination, meaning that the crime of apartheid can be committed in the absence&#160;<br/>of an existing regime of systematic oppression and domination as long as there is an intent to establish&#160;<br/>such a regime, while the Rome Statute requirement that the inhumane acts be committed within the&#160;<br/>context of the regime implies that the regime must already exist.37&#160;Nevertheless, considering the gravity&#160;<br/>and scale of the crime of apartheid, it is unlikely that the crime will be prosecuted in the absence of&#160;<br/>an existing system of oppression and domination, especially where the intent is implied from existing&#160;<br/>

of oppression and domination.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=49></a>conduct.38&#160;For the purposes of this report, Amnesty International has applied the more stringent (or&#160;<br/>narrow) definition in the Rome Statute, which better reflects apartheid as a crime against humanity&#160;<br/>under customary international law.<br/>
The second difference is that the list of “inhumane” acts proscribed in the Rome Statute appears more&#160;<br/>restricted than the list of “inhuman acts” in the Apartheid Convention. Indeed, as shown, the inhuman&#160;<br/>acts proscribed in the Apartheid Convention include both inherently violent ones and more systemic&#160;<br/>acts designed to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political, social, economic&#160;<br/>and cultural life of the country and deny them basic human rights and freedoms.&#160;<br/>
At first glance the list of inhumane acts in the Rome Statute&#160;appears restricted to the more violent acts&#160;<br/>such as murder and torture. However, a closer look points both to the inhumane act of persecution&#160;<br/>proscribed in Article 7(1)(h) and defined in Article 7(2)(g) as&#160;“the intentional and severe deprivation&#160;<br/>of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity”&#160;<br/>as well as “other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious&#160;<br/>injury to body or to mental or physical health”, proscribed in Article 7(1)(k), which together would&#160;<br/>cover all the proscribed inhuman acts under the Apartheid Convention that do not on the face of it&#160;<br/>appear in the Rome Statute definition.39<br/>
With respect to international human rights law, the ICERD does not define apartheid. However, at&#160;<br/>the very least, systems, regimes and practices that meet the&#160;definitions contained in the crime of&#160;<br/>apartheid under the Apartheid Convention40&#160;and the Rome Statute41&#160;would amount to a violation&#160;<br/>of the international human rights prohibition in the ICERD. The public international law prohibition&#160;<br/>of apartheid is best found in an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice relating to&#160;<br/>South Africa’s presence in Namibia (Namibia case), where the violation is defined as “distinctions,&#160;<br/>exclusions, restrictions and limitations exclusively based on grounds of race, colour, descent or national&#160;<br/>or ethnic origin which constitute a denial of fundamental human rights”.42&#160;While the ICERD and public&#160;<br/>international law definitions may be broader than the definition&#160;under international criminal law, the&#160;<br/>violation is considered one of the most grave and serious. Considering the seriousness of the violation,&#160;<br/>this report thus applies the structural elements of the international criminal law definition to determine&#160;<br/>whether the systematic discrimination practised by Israel against the Palestinian people amounts to&#160;<br/>the human rights violation prohibited by the ICERD and public international law, namely whether it&#160;<br/>amounts to a system of “oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or&#160;<br/>groups”.43<br/>
38.&#160;&#160;International law expert Miles Jackson has argued that “[i]n practice, this difference may not amount to a great deal, given that the&#160;<br/>
kinds of acts sufficient to ground an inference of the required purpose will often mean that&#160;the relevant context under the Rome Statute has&#160;<br/>
been established”. See Miles Jackson, “Expert Opinion on the Interplay between the Legal Regime Applicable to Belligerent&#160;Occupation&#160;<br/>
and the Prohibition of Apartheid under International Law”, 23 March 2021,&#160;<a href="https://www.diakonia.se/ihl/news/israel-palestine-publication/expert-opinion-occupation-palestine-apartheid/">diakonia.se/ihl/news/israel-palestine-publication/expert-opinion-</a><br/>

rights prohibition in the ICERD and other treaties and statements of international bodies. In this report, Amnesty International has chosen to&#160;<br/>
modify this definition with the definition of the crime against humanity under the Rome&#160;Statute to reflect any modifications to custom that&#160;<br/>
have arisen from the widespread ratification and domestication of the Statute.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=50></a><b>4.2 INSTITUTIONALIZED REGIME OF SYSTEMATIC&#160;</b><br/>
<b>OPPRESSION AND DOMINATION&#160;<br/></b>As per its definition under the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute, the crime against humanity&#160;<br/>of apartheid requires the intention to create and/or maintain an institutionalized regime for the purpose of&#160;<br/>the systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups. The&#160;<br/>Rome Statute explicitly requires the existence of “an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and&#160;<br/>domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of&#160;<br/>maintaining that regime”.44&#160;The Apartheid Convention does not expressly use the term “institutionalized&#160;<br/>regime”, but a similar requirement can be gleaned from its definition&#160;of apartheid. Among other things, the&#160;<br/>convention describes the crime of apartheid as including “similar policies and practices of racial segregation&#160;<br/>and discrimination as practised in southern Africa,”45&#160;which indisputably involved institutionalized racial&#160;<br/>oppression and domination. The definition also specifically includes&#160;“legislative measures”, clearly an&#160;<br/>“institutionalized” measure, among the “inhuman acts” constituting offences of apartheid. Thus, it is&#160;<br/>Amnesty International’s assessment that for the proscribed acts listed under both the Apartheid Convention&#160;<br/>and the Rome Statute to amount to the crime of apartheid, they must be committed in “the context of an&#160;<br/>institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination”.&#160;<br/>
“Systematic oppression” and “domination” are not defined in either&#160;the Apartheid Convention or the Rome&#160;<br/>Statute. The terms are very similar and scholars indicate that they should be read cumulatively to mean&#160;<br/>ruling or treating people with continual injustice or cruelty while exercising a very strong control or influence&#160;<br/>over them.46&#160;Drawing from both the dictionary definitions of oppression and&#160;domination and the commentary&#160;<br/>of experts, these terms should be understood to require the systematic, prolonged, and cruel47&#160;discriminatory&#160;<br/>treatment by one racial group of members of another with the intention to control the second racial group.&#160;<br/>To interpret the term “systematic” in the general definition of crimes&#160;against humanity, the ICC,48&#160;following&#160;<br/>international criminal tribunals, has used terms such as “non-accidental repetition”,49&#160;“following a regular&#160;<br/>pattern”,50&#160;“continuous commission of crimes”,51&#160;and “the organised nature of the acts of violence and&#160;<br/>the improbability of their random occurrence”.52&#160;The word must be read to have the same meaning in the&#160;<br/>definition of the crime of apartheid, requiring an element of organization and planning in relation to the&#160;<br/>commission of the crime, which is reinforced by the requirement of the existence of a regime.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=51></a>The element of an “institutionalized regime” of systematic oppression and domination may entail a wide&#160;<br/>range of discriminatory and exclusionary laws, policies and practices that are imposed by the state or,&#160;<br/>in certain circumstances, an armed group for the purpose of maintaining domination (or control) by one&#160;<br/>racial group over any other racial group or groups. Indeed, “it is this institutionalized element, involving a&#160;<br/>state-sanctioned regime of law, policy, and institutions, that distinguishes the practice of apartheid from&#160;<br/>other forms of prohibited discrimination.”53&#160;A regime in this context is understood to refer to “a method or&#160;<br/>system of organising or doing [something]”.54&#160;Consequently, apartheid consists of a system of prolonged&#160;<br/>and cruel55&#160; discriminatory treatment by one racial group of members of another with the intention to&#160;<br/>control the second racial group. While the discriminatory treatment must be organized and planned to the&#160;<br/>extent that it must not merely be the repetition of incidental and unlinked human rights violations, there&#160;<br/>is no need for an expressly adopted plan to subject one racial group to oppression and domination. This&#160;<br/>policy element can thus be inferred from the conduct of the perpetrators.56&#160;<br/>
<b>4.3 OPPRESSION AND DOMINATION OF A RACIAL GROUP&#160;<br/></b>The concept of distinct human races has been discredited and it is recognized that all human beings&#160;<br/>make up one biological race.57&#160;Nevertheless, states, peoples and individuals continue to discriminate&#160;<br/>against other nations, peoples and individuals based on socially constructed understandings of racial&#160;<br/>differences, and it is this unjust prejudicial treatment that international law prohibits. Thus, while there is&#160;<br/>no objective distinction between different racial groups, international law prohibits discrimination against&#160;<br/>others based on perceived membership of racial groups. To enforce this law, courts will be called upon to&#160;<br/>explain and apply subjective understandings of manufactured differences.58<br/>
Although the prohibition and criminalization of the system of apartheid arose in South Africa, the&#160;<br/>conventions and treaties that condemn, prohibit and criminalize it are drafted in a universal manner.&#160;<br/>Nevertheless, some scholars have argued that reference should be made to the definition of race in South&#160;<br/>Africa,59&#160;effectively arguing that race should be synonymous with colour. However, even within the South&#160;<br/>African apartheid regime culture was considered an important determinant of “race”.60<br/>

of a… racial group from the point of view of those persons who wish to single that group&#160;out from the rest of the community. The Trial&#160;<br/>
Chamber consequently elects to evaluate membership in a… racial group using a subjective criterion. It is the stigmatisation of a group as&#160;<br/>

<a name=52></a>Indeed, while it appears that in the definition of race in South Africa&#160;skin colour was one factor it was not&#160;<br/>the only way in which the dominant group identified individuals in other racial groups for discrimination.61&#160;<br/>Further, the term “black” was used, both within South Africa and within the international community in its&#160;<br/>response to the crimes committed in South Africa, to refer to all those groups that suffered the oppression of&#160;<br/>apartheid (defined broadly and including so-called “Asian”, “coloured”&#160;and “native” people).62&#160;The concepts&#160;<br/>of “race” or “racial group” in South African law were used as subjective tools of oppression and do not&#160;<br/>establish the basis of a universal definition of the terms, the meaning of which will depend on the context (as&#160;<br/>seen below).&#160;<br/>
Accepting that the definitions under historic South African law give little assistance in understanding the&#160;<br/>concept of “racial group” under international law, and turning to international law itself, neither public&#160;<br/>international law nor international human rights law defines the concept&#160;of a racial group. International&#160;<br/>human rights law instruments have, instead, dealt more broadly with “racial discrimination”. The ICERD&#160;<br/>defines “racial discrimination” to mean:<br/>
<i>… any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or&#160;<br/>ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or&#160;<br/>exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,&#160;<br/>social, cultural or any other field of public life.63</i><br/>
In the Namibia case, the International Court of Justice also adopted the broader understanding of racial&#160;<br/>discrimination. In condemning South Africa’s enforcement of apartheid in Namibia, the court stated:&#160;<br/>
<i>To establish instead, and to enforce, distinctions, exclusions, restrictions and limitations exclusively&#160;<br/>based on grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which constitute a denial of&#160;<br/>fundamental human rights is a flagrant violation of the purposes and&#160;principles of the Charter.64</i><br/>
These definitions therefore allow an understanding of race as a social&#160;construct that encompass issues such&#160;<br/>as “colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin”.65&#160;CERD has held that racial discrimination as defined in the&#160;<br/>convention covers a wider range of identities to include “caste” and “nationality”,66&#160;although the International&#160;<br/>Court of Justice has held that “national origin” in the ICERD must be&#160;interpreted more narrowly to “denote…&#160;<br/>a person’s bond to a national… group at birth”.67&#160;Thus, when defining apartheid under international human&#160;<br/>rights law or public international law, any systematic denial of fundamental rights arising from distinctions,&#160;<br/>exclusions, restrictions and limitations (or any institutionalized regime of oppression and domination) based&#160;<br/>solely on “colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin” would constitute the international wrong of apartheid.&#160;<br/>
61.&#160;&#160;See an analysis of the often contradictory apartheid laws on this in Carola Lingaas,&#160;<i>The Concept of Race in International Criminal Law</i>&#160;<br/>
(previously cited), p. 159. See also Carola Lingaas, “Jewish Israeli and Palestinians as distinct ‘racial groups’ within the meaning of the&#160;<br/>
crime of apartheid?” (previously cited).<br/>
62.&#160;&#160;Carola Lingaas,&#160;<i>The Concept of Race in International Criminal Law</i>&#160;(previously cited), p. 158. At the same time “white” was used by the&#160;<br/>
regime in South Africa to define all those who benefited from the system of apartheid, collapsing existing distinctions and demonstrating an&#160;<br/>
evolution of this term within the system of oppression and domination as developed in the country.&#160;<br/>

65.&#160;&#160;Indeed, in South Africa the definition of race went beyond colour to include concepts such&#160;as culture. See Carola Lingaas,&#160;<i>The&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Concept of Race in International Criminal Law</i>&#160;(previously cited): “Individuals were categorised on the basis of their appearance, social&#160;<br/>

attribute which is within the discretionary power of the State and can change during a person’s lifetime... The Court notes that the other&#160;<br/>

are also characteristics that are inherent at birth…” ICJ, Application of the International&#160;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial&#160;<br/>

<a name=53></a>Turning to international criminal law, the situation is equally complicated. The Apartheid Convention and the&#160;<br/>Rome Statute both provide that the crime of apartheid relates specifically to the systematic oppression and&#160;<br/>domination by “one racial group over any other racial group or groups” with the knowledge and intention&#160;<br/>of maintaining that regime. However, the term “racial group” has not been defined in either of these&#160;<br/>instruments.&#160;<br/>
An initial point here is the link between international human rights law and international criminal law.&#160;<br/>The Apartheid Convention invokes the ICERD in its preamble, and thus the understanding of race and&#160;<br/>racial discrimination as defined in the ICERD may be relevant to the&#160;interpretation of the same term in the&#160;<br/>Apartheid Convention,68&#160;even if caution is called for to ensure compliance with the requirements of legality,&#160;<br/>foreseeability and specificity in the interpretation of international criminal&#160;law.69&#160;Further, the drafters of the&#160;<br/>Rome Statute would have been influenced by the meaning of “racial groups” in the Genocide Convention, by&#160;<br/>the understanding in the Apartheid Convention and by the more subjective understanding of race and “racial&#160;<br/>group” that had been accepted by both international criminal tribunals and international human rights&#160;<br/>mechanisms by the late 1990s.70&#160;It is therefore likely that a court applying the definitions&#160;in either the Rome&#160;<br/>Statute or the Apartheid Convention would give a broad definition to&#160;“racial groups”.&#160;<br/>
International criminal tribunals and courts have discussed and interpreted the term “racial group” in the&#160;<br/>context of other crimes (such as genocide) under international law.71&#160;The jurisprudence has not been&#160;<br/>altogether consistent and has recognized the difficulty in conclusively&#160;defining “racial groups”. Initially, there&#160;<br/>were attempts to provide a definition of a “racial group” in a way that&#160;is largely “objective”, for instance as&#160;<br/>“based on the hereditary physical traits often identified with a geographical&#160;region, irrespective of linguistics,&#160;<br/>cultural, national or religious factors”.72&#160;However, international courts later acknowledged that membership of&#160;<br/>
68.&#160;&#160;Carola Lingaas recognizes in&#160;<i>The Concept of Race in International Criminal Law</i>&#160;(previously cited) that international human rights law&#160;<br/>
may assist in the interpretation of international criminal law but argues that the ICERD definition of race would be too broad (noting the&#160;<br/>
circular definition of race as including “race, colour, descent, and national and ethnic origin”). She relies on Steven Ratner and others,&#160;<br/>
<i>Accountability for Human Rights Atrocities in International Law: Beyond the Nuremberg Legacy</i>&#160;(previously cited), p. 126; and Corsin&#160;<br/>
Bisaz,&#160;<i>The Concept of Group Rights in International Law: Groups as Contested Right-Holders, Subjects and Legal Persons</i>, 2012, p. 103.&#160;<br/>
Other scholars have emphasized the links between the concepts in international human rights law and international criminal law&#160;and&#160;<br/>
advocated adopting the ICERD definition to explain “racial groups” in the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. John Dugard and&#160;<br/>
John Reynolds, “Apartheid, International Law, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories” (previously cited), p. 886; UN Economic and Social&#160;<br/>

69.&#160;&#160;See Carola Lingaas, “Jewish Israeli and Palestinians as distinct ‘racial groups’ within the&#160;meaning of the crime of apartheid?”&#160;<br/>
(previously cited), which raises the concern that too broad a definition of “racial groups”&#160;in the international criminal law context could&#160;<br/>
violate the principle of legality (particularly related to the requirement of foreseeability). However, the jurisprudence of both international&#160;<br/>
criminal courts and international human rights bodies leads to a definition of “racial group” as a social construct with possible overlap&#160;<br/>
with colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, while being primarily a subjective question in the eyes of the perpetrator. Indeed, the&#160;<br/>
ICTY has cautioned against any attempt to disentangle “national, ethnical, racial or religious groups” as the list appears in the Genocide&#160;<br/>
Convention since the prohibition appeared aimed at what was recognized before the Second World War as “national minorities” and that&#160;<br/>
any “attempt to differentiate each of the named groups on the basis of scientifically objective criteria would thus be inconsistent with&#160;<br/>
the object and purpose of the Convention”. See ICTY,&#160;<i>Prosecutor v. Krstić</i>, Case IT-98-33, Trial Chamber judgment, 2 August 2001. This&#160;<br/>
holistic understanding of race and racial discrimination appears to have influenced the&#160;drafting of the ICERD and must be the basis of an&#160;<br/>
interpretation of the Apartheid Convention.&#160;<br/>

noteworthy that the Apartheid Convention was modelled on the Genocide Convention and neither treaty defines “racial group”. See Steven&#160;<br/>

phrase “often identified with” introduces an element of subjectivity. In addition, the decision is much criticized. International law expert&#160;<br/>
William Schabas, for example, has noted that the understanding of race expressed in this decision was at odds with the understanding of&#160;<br/>
race that was prevalent in 1948 when the Genocide Convention was adopted (which was much broader and would have included “national,&#160;<br/>
ethnic, and even religious minorities”). See William Schabas, “Groups Protected by the&#160;Genocide Convention: Conflicting Interpretations&#160;<br/>
from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda”, June 2000, ILSA Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law, Volume 6, Issue&#160;<br/>
2,&#160;<a href="https://nsuworks.nova.edu/ilsajournal/vol6/iss2/10/">nsuworks.nova.edu/ilsajournal/vol6/iss2/10</a>&#160;Indeed, in 1948 the term “racial group” would have included groups such as Germans,&#160;<br/>
Poles and the Jews. See Diane Marie Amann, “Group Mentality, Expressivism, and Genocide”, January 2002, International Criminal&#160;<br/>
Law Review, Volume 2, Issue 2, p. 98. In fact, in the context of crimes committed by Nazi Germany, a number of courts considered that&#160;<br/>
Jews constituted a racial group. See, for example, British Military Court,&#160;<i>United Kingdom v. Kramer and Others</i>&#160;(“Belsen Trial”), 1947, 2&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=54></a>a racial group is largely “a subjective rather than objective concept”.73&#160;As a result, international courts have&#160;<br/>increasingly (though not always consistently) referred to such groups in terms of perceptions, at times by&#160;<br/>victims but more often by perpetrators, since it is the latter that determine who is to be victimized, and on a&#160;<br/>case-by-case basis.74<br/>
Racial groups can therefore be considered as groups “who are perceived as being different and possibly&#160;<br/>inferior by other groups on account of particular physical and/or cultural attributes”.75&#160;This position has been&#160;<br/>summarized as follows: “the question of race is connected to the labelling and stigmatisation of members&#160;<br/>of a group, singled out by the perpetrator as targets of his criminal acts. The perpetrator dominates a group&#160;<br/>he considers and treats as inferior.”76&#160;Thus, “if a group is perceived and treated as a distinct racial group, it&#160;<br/>would qualify as a racial group in the meaning of the crime of apartheid.”77<br/>
It is this subjective understanding of “racial groups” that is applied by Amnesty International in this report&#160;<br/>with regard to the crime against humanity of apartheid.&#160;<br/>
<b>4.4 CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY&#160;<br/></b>Crimes against humanity are offences committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed&#160;<br/>against a civilian population pursuant to, or in furtherance of, a state or organizational policy.78&#160;Crimes&#160;<br/>against humanity are among the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a&#160;<br/>whole. These crimes constitute crimes under international law, and as such are criminal wherever they are&#160;<br/>committed, whether or not they are criminal under domestic law, and whether or not the state concerned&#160;<br/>has ratified the Rome Statute. They are prohibited during war or peace. Since the crime of apartheid under&#160;<br/>international law is defined as a crime against humanity, those requirements of crimes against humanity&#160;<br/>developed under conventional and customary international law must apply.79<br/>
Four legal requirements are common to all crimes against humanity:&#160;<br/>
1.&#160;&#160;the underlying offence must be committed as part of a “widespread or systematic attack”;&#160;<br/>
2.&#160;&#160;the attack must be “directed against the civilian population”;80&#160;<br/>

<a name=55></a>3.&#160;&#160;the underlying offence must be carried out with knowledge of the attack; and&#160;<br/>
4.&#160;&#160;the attack must be carried out as part of state or organizational policy.&#160;<br/>
These general requirements establish the context in which specific prohibited acts must take place for them&#160;<br/>to be considered crimes against humanity. In addition, each specific&#160;crime against humanity requires proof&#160;<br/>of additional elements related to the specific underlying offence. Thus, with respect to the crime against&#160;<br/>humanity of apartheid, in addition to these general requirements, further requirements include the existence&#160;<br/>of a regime of systematic oppression and domination (see section 4.2 “Institutionalized regime of systematic&#160;<br/>oppression and domination”), of one racial group over another or others (see section 4.3 “Oppression and&#160;<br/>domination of a racial group”) and the commission of inhuman or inhumane acts (see section 4.5 “Inhuman&#160;<br/>and inhumane acts”) with the specific intention to maintain (under the&#160;Rome Statute), or to establish or&#160;<br/>maintain (under the Apartheid Convention), this regime of systematic oppression and domination (see&#160;<br/>section 4.6 “Special intent”).<br/>
An attack does not need to be both widespread and systematic; an attack that is either widespread or&#160;<br/>systematic will suffice. International criminal case law has helped to&#160;define what is required for an attack&#160;<br/>to be considered widespread or systematic. While one factor involved in determining whether an attack&#160;<br/>is widespread is the number of victims or magnitude of the acts,81&#160;the term can also have a geographical&#160;<br/>dimension.82&#160;The term “widespread” has been interpreted by various international criminal tribunals to&#160;<br/>refer to a “multiplicity of victims”, and to exclude isolated acts of violence and can have a geographical&#160;<br/>dimension.83&#160;The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber has indicated that the assessment of whether an act is widespread&#160;<br/>“is neither exclusively quantitative nor geographical, but must be carried out on the basis of the individual&#160;<br/>facts.”84&#160;Therefore, an attack may be “widespread” due to the cumulative effect of multiple inhumane acts or&#160;<br/>the result of a single inhumane act of great magnitude.85<br/>
The term “systematic” means that the crimes and other prohibited acts have been committed in an&#160;<br/>organized manner and that it is unlikely they are merely random events.86&#160;International courts have&#160;<br/>commonly held that the systematic threshold is met when there are “[p]atterns of crimes – that is, the&#160;<br/>nonaccidental repetition of similar criminal conducted on a regular basis”.87<br/>
“Attack directed against any civilian population” is defined in Article&#160;7(2)(a) of the Rome Statute as “a&#160;<br/>course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in [Article 7(1)] against any civilian&#160;<br/>population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy to commit such attack.”88&#160;The&#160;<br/>jurisprudence of the international criminal tribunals has made it clear that there is no requirement for a&#160;<br/>

<a name=56></a>military attack, and that ill-treatment of the civilian population may suffice.89&#160;The term “directed” emphasizes&#160;<br/>the intention of the attack rather than the physical result of the attack,90&#160;meaning that “civilians” are the&#160;<br/>primary intended targets of the attack rather than incidental victims.91<br/>
It is rare for governments to express a policy to direct an attack at the civilian population. Thus, the policy&#160;<br/>element is generally implied from the organized nature of the attack,92&#160;especially when the crimes consist&#160;<br/>of “repeated actions occurring according to a same sequence, or… [follow] preparations or collective&#160;<br/>mobilisation orchestrated and coordinated by that State or organisation.”93<br/>
In the context of the crime against humanity of apartheid the existence of a system of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination of one racial group over another would appear by its nature to satisfy the requirement that the&#160;<br/>underlying inhuman or inhumane act be committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed&#160;<br/>against the civilian population.&#160;<br/>
Individuals are criminally responsible for crimes against humanity when they commit any of the underlying&#160;<br/>offences, as long as they have a degree of knowledge about the contextual elements of the crime. Notably,&#160;<br/>perpetrators must have known that their actions were part of a widespread or systematic attack.94&#160;However,&#160;<br/>an individual does not need to be personally responsible for the actual widespread or systematic attack to&#160;<br/>be found guilty; a single act can be sufficient if – and only if – it is carried out in the context of a broader&#160;<br/>attack of which the perpetrator was aware.95&#160;Individuals, whether civilian or military, can be held criminally&#160;<br/>responsible for crimes against humanity for committing, co-perpetrating, indirectly perpetrating, planning,&#160;<br/>ordering, or aiding and abetting these crimes, as well as for command responsibility.96<br/>
It is not required that all members of a civilian population (or racial group) be a target of or subject to&#160;<br/>inhuman&#160;or&#160;inhumane&#160;acts.&#160;International&#160;tribunals&#160;have&#160;interpreted&#160;the&#160;term&#160;“population”,&#160;in&#160;the&#160;definition&#160;of&#160;<br/>crimes against humanity, to refer to the “collective nature of the crime as an attack upon multiple victims”97&#160;&#160;<br/>and is more than just “a limited and randomly selected number of individuals”,98&#160;but not necessarily the&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=57></a>“entire population”. As such, the system of oppression and domination may be achieved by targeting only&#160;<br/>part of the group, and subgroups may experience the system of segregation and domination in different ways.<br/>
<b>4.5 INHUMAN AND INHUMANE ACTS&#160;<br/></b>The “inhuman acts” defined under Article II of the Apartheid Convention and the “inhumane acts”&#160;<br/>enumerated under Article 7(1) of the Rome Statute constitute the physical element, or factual&#160;<br/>circumstances, of the crime against humanity of apartheid, which include the commission of any of the&#160;<br/>listed acts as long as the contextual elements are present. While the Apartheid Convention uses the term&#160;<br/>“inhuman” and the Rome Statute uses the term “inhumane”, there is no reason to view the two as distinct.&#160;<br/>
In defining crimes under the Rome Statute, its drafters consistently&#160;sought to reflect and reproduce the&#160;<br/>definitions of existing crimes under existing international treaties rather&#160;than create new ones.99&#160;There is no&#160;<br/>indication that their intention was different in the case of the crime of apartheid. The drafters of the Rome&#160;<br/>Statute were clearly aware of the Apartheid Convention, even “copying and pasting” some of its language.100&#160;<br/>When determining which “other inhumane acts” are of such similarity to the prohibited acts under Article&#160;<br/>7(1) of the Rome Statute so as to constitute the crime of apartheid, it is logical that these acts should&#160;<br/>include those that constitute the crime of apartheid under Article II of the Apartheid Convention,101&#160;a position&#160;<br/>supported by several legal scholars102&#160;and one that a reasonable court is likely to adopt.103&#160;Therefore, when&#160;<br/>interpreting the list of inhumane acts listed in Article 7(1) for the crime against humanity of apartheid, this&#160;<br/>report includes the list of inhuman acts from the Apartheid Convention.<br/>
<b>4.6 SPECIAL INTENT&#160;<br/></b>The crime of apartheid under customary international law, the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute&#160;<br/>requires the special intent to establish or maintain104&#160;a system of racial oppression and domination, in&#160;<br/>addition to the general knowledge of the commission of the crime required in all crimes against humanity&#160;<br/>under the Rome Statute. The mental element (mens rea) of the crime of apartheid is that the perpetrator&#160;<br/>
99.&#160;&#160;For instance, the definition of the crime of genocide (Article 8) reproduces, mostly word&#160;for word, the definition of the crime under&#160;<br/>
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (adopted by UNGA Resolution 260 A (III) on 9 December&#160;<br/>
1948, entered into force on 12 January 1951). The same is true of the list of war crimes (Article 8), which by and large reproduces “grave&#160;<br/>
breaches” under the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and their two Additional Protocols.<br/>
100.&#160;The phrase “domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups” in Article 7(2)(h) of the Rome Statute was&#160;copied&#160;<br/>
from Article II(c) of the Apartheid Convention.&#160;<br/>
101.&#160;In other words, “inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or&#160;<br/>
physical health” (Rome Statute, Article 7(1)(k)), which in the specific circumstances constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid&#160;<br/>
(Rome Statute, Article 7(1)(j)).&#160;<br/>

“Article 7 – Crimes against humanity” (previously cited), p. 284; Carola Lingaas, “The Crime against Humanity of Apartheid in&#160;a Post-<br/>
Apartheid World” (previously cited), pp. 96-97. Further, the provision in Article 7(2)(h) of the Rome Statute that defines “apartheid”&#160;<br/>
indicates that the “inhumane acts” constituting apartheid must be “of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1 [of Article 7]”&#160;<br/>
rather&#160;than&#160;specifying&#160;that&#160;they&#160;must&#160;be&#160;limited&#160;to&#160;precisely&#160;such&#160;acts,&#160;and&#160;therefore&#160;confirms&#160;that&#160;the&#160;definition&#160;includes&#160;acts&#160;not&#160;contained&#160;<br/>
within the strict confines of paragraph 1. See, for example, Mark Klamberg (editor),&#160;<i>Commentary on the Law of the International Criminal&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Court</i>, 2017, cmn-kh.org/clicc, p. 59. In addition, the list of inhumane acts in Article 7(1) is open as it includes “other inhumane&#160;acts” in&#160;<br/>
Article 7(1)(k).<br/>
103.&#160;Indeed, one of the inhumane acts proscribed as a crime against humanity in Article 7 of the Rome Statute is the crime of persecution,&#160;<br/>
which is defined as “the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of&#160;<br/>
the group or collectivity”, and as such matches the more extensive list in the Apartheid Convention. See Miles Jackson, “Expert&#160;Opinion”&#160;<br/>
(previously cited), para. 23.<br/>
104.&#160;Under the Rome Statute the special intent is to maintain the system; an intention to establish such a regime would not be sufficient.&#160;<br/>

Intent here must not be understood to imply motive,110&#160;especially not a requirement of racial hatred or&#160;<br/>animosity. The intent required relates merely to creating or maintaining the system. This intent may be&#160;<br/>the ultimate goal or it may be incidental to or seen as necessary to achieve some other goal.111&#160;While in&#160;<br/>some cases the intention to create and maintain a system of oppression and domination will be explicit,&#160;<br/>in most cases the special intent will need to be inferred from the facts. Indeed, in the context of genocide,&#160;<br/>international tribunals have had to infer intent in a number of cases where it was not explicit, and it has held&#160;<br/>that, while this must be done with care,112&#160;specific intent “may, in the absence of direct explicit evidence, be&#160;<br/>inferred from a number of facts and circumstances”. These include “the general context, the perpetration&#160;<br/>of other culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, the scale of atrocities committed, the&#160;<br/>systematic targeting of victims on account of their membership of a particular group, or the repetition of&#160;<br/>destructive and discriminatory acts.”113<br/>
<b>4.7 APARTHEID IN SITUATIONS OF BELLIGERENT&#160;</b><br/>
<b>OCCUPATION&#160;<br/></b>The condemnation, prohibition and criminalization of apartheid extend to situations of occupation.114&#160;One of&#160;<br/>the key aims of the law of occupation is to enable the inhabitants of an occupied territory to live as “normal”&#160;<br/>a life as possible, whilst allowing the occupying power to take measures strictly necessary to maintain order&#160;<br/>and security.115&#160;In the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the occupying power&#160;<br/>“has a duty to ensure the protection, security, and welfare of the people living under occupation and to&#160;<br/>

115.&#160;The situation of belligerent occupation is partly governed by international humanitarian&#160;law, including specific provisions of the Hague&#160;<br/>
Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annexed Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on&#160;<br/>
Land (Hague Regulations) of 18 October 1907; the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War&#160;<br/>
of 12 August 1949; and customary rules of international humanitarian law applicable to belligerent occupation, including the rule protecting&#160;<br/>
persons in the power of a party to the conflict, detailed in Article 75 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August&#160;<br/>
1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I). The ICJ and UN human rights treaty bodies&#160;<br/>
have affirmed that an occupying power’s conduct in occupied territory is bound not only by international humanitarian law but also by its&#160;<br/>
obligations under the international human rights treaties that it has ratified, as well as customary rules of international human rights law.<br/>

The Fourth Geneva Convention imposes specific obligations on an occupying power in relation to the&#160;<br/>inhabitants of the occupied territory, who are entitled to special protection and humane treatment. The&#160;<br/>occupying power is responsible for the welfare of the population under its control. Among other things, the&#160;<br/>rules prohibit the occupying power from wilfully killing, ill-treating or transferring or deporting protected&#160;<br/>persons. The occupying power is prohibited from settling its own civilians in the occupied territory. It is&#160;<br/>strictly prohibited from depriving the occupied population of the protection of the Fourth Geneva Convention,&#160;<br/>whether by annexation or other means.&#160;<br/>
While the law of occupation allows, and in some cases requires, differential treatment between nationals of&#160;<br/>the occupying power and the population of the occupied territory,117&#160;it does not allow the occupying power to&#160;<br/>do this where the intention is to establish or maintain a system of racial oppression and domination as to do&#160;<br/>so would violate a peremptory norm of international law118&#160;(the prohibition of apartheid).119&#160;<br/>
Further, Article 85(4)(c) of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and&#160;<br/>Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&#160;(Protocol I) of 1977 lists “practices&#160;<br/>of&#160;<i>apartheid</i>&#160;and other inhuman and degrading practices involving outrages upon personal dignity, based&#160;<br/>on racial discrimination”120&#160;as grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, when committed wilfully. The&#160;<br/>commentary clarifies that it is not an “on the battlefield” violation but&#160;concerns acts prejudicial to the rights&#160;<br/>of persons in the power of the enemy, which could include civilians, prisoners of war and other persons&#160;<i>hors&#160;<br/>de combat</i>.121&#160;The war crime of apartheid will thus, among others things, be committed where an occupying&#160;<br/>power establishes and maintains a system or regime of oppression and domination of the occupied&#160;<br/>population as a racial group with the purpose of benefiting its nationals&#160;as a racial group.122&#160;Prohibited acts&#160;<br/>perpetrated to maintain systems of apartheid when committed in territories under belligerent occupation&#160;<br/>would therefore constitute both the crime against humanity of apartheid and the war crime of apartheid.<br/>
<b>4.8 SYSTEM AND CRIME OF APARTHEID&#160;<br/></b>Apartheid as condemned by the ICERD and public international law constitutes the (creation and)&#160;<br/>maintenance of a system or institutionalized regime of oppression and domination by one racial group over&#160;<br/>another. In practice this means a system of laws, policies and practices that ensure the prolonged and cruel&#160;<br/>discriminatory treatment by one racial group of members of another with the intention of controlling the&#160;<br/>second racial group. &#160;<br/>

<a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/west-bank-israel-must-abide-international-humanitarian-law">israel-must-abide-international-humanitarian-law</a>. See also Hague Regulations, Article 43. However, there are some caveats to this&#160;<br/>
obligation, including that where the laws, cultures and traditions of the occupied people constitute a grave violation of international human&#160;<br/>
rights law, the occupying power may be under an obligation to change or prohibit these laws, cultures and traditions, and that failure to do&#160;<br/>
so may lead to its being held responsible. This obligation would include situations where the laws in place establish a regime&#160;or system of&#160;<br/>
apartheid; see Miles Jackson, “Expert Opinion” (previously cited), paras 43 and 44.&#160;<br/>
117.&#160;See Hague Regulations, Article 43, and Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 64. The differential treatment is primarily required&#160;because&#160;<br/>
international humanitarian law prohibits the occupying power from applying its own laws to the population in the occupied territories and&#160;<br/>
therefore envisages different laws applying to its citizens and the population of the occupied territories.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=60></a>The crime against humanity of apartheid under the Rome Statute and customary international law is&#160;<br/>committed when (a) an inhuman or inhumane act, which is a serious human rights violation, (b) is&#160;<br/>committed within the context of a system of laws, policies and practices that ensure the prolonged and cruel&#160;<br/>discriminatory treatment by one racial group of another with the intention to control the second racial group,&#160;<br/>(c) with the special intent of maintaining that system.123<br/>
123.&#160;As seen above, the Rome Statute definition best reflects the definition of the crime against humanity under customary international law.&#160;<br/>
Since the crime of apartheid is a crime against humanity, these inhuman acts must be committed as part of a widespread or systematic&#160;<br/>
attack directed against the civilian population. This contextual element will be met in most situations where a system of oppression and&#160;<br/>
domination is in existence. Each individual perpetrator accused of the crime against humanity of apartheid will also need to have knowledge&#160;<br/>
of the attack but as this report does not consider individual criminal responsibility there has been no further analysis of this aspect.&#160;<br/>

<a name=61></a><b>5. ISRAEL’S OPPRESSION&#160;</b><br/>
<b>AND DOMINATION OF&#160;</b><br/>
<b>PALESTINIANS&#160;</b><br/>
As outlined above, apartheid consists of a system of prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment by one&#160;<br/>racial group of members of another with the intention to control the second racial group. This chapter&#160;<br/>examines the extent to which Israel has created such a system of oppression and domination over&#160;<br/>Palestinians in all areas under its jurisdiction and effective control, as well as over Palestinian refugees&#160;<br/>whose right of return to their homes remains controlled by Israel. It does&#160;so by first establishing Israel’s&#160;<br/>intent to oppress and dominate all Palestinians by establishing its hegemony across Israel and the OPT,&#160;<br/>including through means of demography, and maximizing resources&#160;for the benefit of its Jewish population&#160;<br/>at the expense of Palestinians. It then analyses the laws, policies and practices which have, over time,&#160;<br/>come to constitute the main tools for establishing and maintaining this system, and which discriminate&#160;<br/>against and segregate Palestinians in Israel and the OPT today, as well as controlling Palestinian refugees’&#160;<br/>right to return. It divides this analysis by the key components of this system of oppression and domination:&#160;<br/>territorial fragmentation, segregation and control, dispossession of land and property and the suppression of&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ human development and deprivation of their economic and social rights.&#160;<br/>
The chapter demonstrates how distinct but interlocking administrative and legal systems in different&#160;<br/>geographic areas have controlled Palestinians’ legal status, deprived them of the right to nationality, placed&#160;<br/>extreme restrictions on their freedom of movement, deprived them of political and civil rights equal to Jewish&#160;<br/>Israelis, and precluded any possibility of them enjoying equality in access to land, property and resources.&#160;<br/>These policies have had disastrous consequences for Palestinians and have deliberately prevented them&#160;<br/>from fulfilling their human potential and accessing equal economic&#160;and social rights, further worsening&#160;<br/>their situation. The chapter concludes that Israel has created a system of oppression and domination over&#160;<br/>Palestinians in all areas under its effective control and over the rights of Palestinian refugees, which amounts&#160;<br/>to apartheid as prohibited by public international law and international human rights law.<br/>
Israel’s system of control has been built and maintained over decades by successive Israeli&#160;<br/>governments across all territories they have controlled, regardless of the political party in power at the&#160;<br/>time. Indeed, Israel has subjected different groups of Palestinians to different sets of discriminatory and&#160;<br/>exclusionary laws, policies and practices at different times, responding to the territorial gains it made&#160;<br/>first in 1948 and then in 1967, when it annexed East Jerusalem and occupied the rest of the West Bank&#160;<br/>and the Gaza Strip. Over decades, Israeli demographic and geopolitical considerations have shaped&#160;<br/>policies towards Palestinians in each of these territorial domains in different ways. This means that,&#160;<br/>today, Israel’s system of control is not applied uniformly across all areas.124&#160;Palestinians experience this&#160;<br/>

Palestinian citizens of Israel are subject to Israeli civil laws, which allow them to vote in national elections&#160;<br/>and, in general, afford them greater human rights protections than Palestinians living in the OPT,&#160;<br/>but nonetheless deny them equal rights with Jewish Israelis (including to political participation) and&#160;<br/>institutionalize discrimination against them. While Palestinians in annexed East Jerusalem also live under&#160;<br/>Israeli civil laws, they can only vote in municipal elections, which they routinely boycott in protest at the&#160;<br/>prolonged occupation, and have a fragile permanent residency status, which can be revoked on a number&#160;<br/>of discriminatory grounds with devastating consequences for their human rights. On the other hand,&#160;<br/>Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank remain subject to Israel’s military rule and draconian military&#160;<br/>orders, while those in the Gaza Strip have been placed under an unlawful blockade and remain cut off,&#160;<br/>under an official “separation” policy, from the rest of the occupied territories as well as the rest of the world,&#160;<br/>without access to essential services. Finally, as stated above, Palestinian refugees displaced over the years&#160;<br/>remain barred from returning to their land and their homes under discriminatory laws and policies, and&#160;<br/>continue to be isolated from other Palestinians in what is today Israel and the OPT.<br/>
Israel’s rule over the OPT through military orders in the context of its occupation has given rise to a false&#160;<br/>perception that the military regime in the OPT is separate from “the civil regime in annexed East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>and pre-1967 Israel”.125&#160;This view ignores the fact that many elements of Israel’s repressive military system&#160;<br/>in the OPT originate in Israel’s 18-year-long military rule over Palestinian citizens of Israel, imposed merely&#160;<br/>months after the creation of the new state in May 1948.126&#160;Similarly, Israel extended many of its discriminatory&#160;<br/>laws against Palestinians in Israel to Palestinians in the OPT through military orders “in most cases, by&#160;<br/>replicating Israeli legislation”.127&#160;Perhaps most importantly, this view ignores the fact that the dispossession&#160;<br/>of Palestinians in Israel continues today, with millions of Palestinian refugees and internally displaced people&#160;<br/>barred from their right to return and denied restitution and compensation. While the human rights situation&#160;<br/>of Palestinian citizens of Israel has generally improved since the end of the military rule over them, which&#160;<br/>removed among other things stringent restrictions on movement, the discriminatory laws and policies they&#160;<br/>were subjected to remain in force today and, crucially, the system that they created was never dismantled.&#160;<br/>
The full integration of West Bank settlements into Israel’s infrastructure, economy, education and court&#160;<br/>systems also points to the existence of one system of oppression and domination. Israeli citizens can travel&#160;<br/>unobstructed along major roads linking settlements in the West Bank with Israeli towns across the Green&#160;<br/>Line, the demarcation line set out in the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and its neighbours that&#160;<br/>served as the de facto borders of the State of Israel until 1967, and the Israeli authorities provide heavy&#160;<br/>subsidies, financial and tax incentives and low-cost utilities and resources to encourage Jewish Israelis to live&#160;<br/>in settlements.128&#160;In addition, Israeli citizens living inside Israel sustain the settlement enterprise by working&#160;<br/>or studying in settlements and by visiting attractions and businesses run by them. For both Israelis and&#160;<br/>Palestinians across all territorial domains, the Israeli Supreme Court&#160;remains the court of final appeal.129<br/>
To date, much of the analysis of the human rights situation faced by Palestinians in Israel and the OPT,&#160;<br/>including by Amnesty International, has been limited by the existence of these separate legal regimes, and&#160;<br/>has failed to address Israeli violations against the Palestinian people holistically, despite long-standing calls&#160;<br/>by Palestinian activists and, more recently, some Israeli NGOs to change this approach. However, as noted in&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a>a 2017 report by ESCWA, which concluded that Israel had “established an apartheid regime that dominates&#160;<br/>the Palestinian people as a whole”, “the method of fragmentation” serves precisely “to obscure [the Israeli&#160;<br/>apartheid] regime’s very existence”.130&#160;Indeed, as will be demonstrated in this chapter, Israeli policies aim to&#160;<br/>fragment Palestinians into different geographic and legal domains of control not only to treat them differently,&#160;<br/>or to segregate them, from the Jewish population, but also to treat them differently from each other in&#160;<br/>order to weaken family, social and political ties between Palestinian communities, to suppress any form of&#160;<br/>sustained dissent against the system they have created, and ensure more effective political and security&#160;<br/>control over land and people across all territories.131<br/>
<b>5.1 INTENT TO OPPRESS AND DOMINATE THE&#160;</b><br/>
<b>PALESTINIAN PEOPLE&#160;<br/></b>Since its establishment in 1948, the State of Israel has pursued an explicit policy of establishing and&#160;<br/>maintaining a Jewish demographic hegemony and maximizing its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis&#160;<br/>while minimizing the number of Palestinians and restricting their rights and obstructing their ability to&#160;<br/>challenge this dispossession. In 1967, Israel extended this policy beyond the Green Line to the West Bank&#160;<br/>and Gaza Strip, which it has occupied ever since. Today, all territories controlled by Israel continue to be&#160;<br/>administered with the purpose of benefiting Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians, while Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees continue to be excluded.&#160;<br/>
Demographic considerations have from the outset guided Israeli legislation and policymaking. The&#160;<br/>demography of the newly created state was to be changed to the benefit of Jewish Israelis, while Palestinians&#160;<br/>– whether inside Israel or, later on, in the OPT – were perceived as a threat to establishing and maintaining&#160;<br/>a Jewish majority, and as a result were to be expelled, fragmented, segregated, controlled, dispossessed of&#160;<br/>their land and property and deprived of their economic and social rights.&#160;<br/>
In May 1948, the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel announced a Jewish state.132&#160;<br/>Although it guaranteed the right to “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants”, this&#160;<br/>has not been given full effect through legislation, and the right has not been guaranteed in the Basic Laws,&#160;<br/>which act as constitutional documents in the absence of a written constitution. Across all the Basic Laws,&#160;<br/>legal provisions on equality are subordinated to those that privilege Jewish Israelis and establish the State of&#160;<br/>Israel as Jewish (see below).&#160;<br/>
At the same time as establishing Israel as a Jewish state, the 1948 Declaration appealed to Jewish people&#160;<br/>around the world to immigrate to Israel and build the country. In 1950, Israel granted every Jew the right&#160;<br/>to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return, while two years later, every Jewish immigrant acquired the&#160;<br/>right to automatic Israeli citizenship under the Nationality Law of 1952.133&#160;The Israeli authorities saw this&#160;<br/>partly as a necessary measure to prevent another attempt to exterminate Jews in the wake of the Holocaust&#160;<br/>and to provide shelter to Jews who faced persecution elsewhere in the world. In 1970, Israel amended the&#160;<br/>Law of Return to extend these rights to the spouses as well as the children and grandchildren of any Jewish&#160;<br/>person.134&#160; Meanwhile, it pursued a clearly discriminatory policy against Palestinian refugees on racial and&#160;<br/>

<a name=64></a>national grounds. In order to maintain Jewish Israeli domination in the territories it controlled, Israel denied&#160;<br/>the right to citizenship and residence to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced during the 1947-<br/>49 conflict or shortly after from land that became recognized as part&#160;of the State of Israel, and to hundreds&#160;<br/>of thousands more displaced in 1967 from the OPT, as well as to their descendants.&#160;<br/>
Indeed, Israel considers the existence of the Palestinian refugee population as a potential threat to maintaining&#160;<br/>a Jewish majority in Israel and therefore the continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state.135&#160; Under Article&#160;<br/>3(a) of the Nationality Law of 1952, Israel conditioned the granting of Israeli citizenship to Palestinians on the&#160;<br/>requirement that they must have continuously inhabited Israel from the day of its establishment on 14 May&#160;<br/>1948 to the day the Nationality Law came into force in April 1952.136&#160;The Nationality Law effectively became&#160;<br/>the basis for denying Palestinian refugees, and later their descendants, their right to gain Israeli citizenship&#160;<br/>or residency status in Israel and thus their right to return to their former places of residence.&#160;<br/>
Palestinian refugees who left their homes during the 1947-49 conflict or shortly after and are now living in&#160;<br/>the West Bank or the Gaza Strip are affected by the same laws and policies and are also prevented from&#160;<br/>gaining citizenship or residency status in Israel. Coupled with the fact that Palestinian residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem are denied the right to vote, this ensures that Palestinians remain limited in terms of political&#160;<br/>participation and their ability to challenge systemic discrimination and oppression, including by becoming an&#160;<br/>electoral power.&#160;<br/>
Over the years Israel has passed laws with constitutional status that provide some protection of the right to&#160;<br/>equality while simultaneously reiterating that the State of Israel is Jewish.137&#160;Israel has also enacted specific&#160;<br/>laws, for example on equal opportunities at work138&#160;and equal opportunities for people with disabilities.139&#160;<br/>Other protections against discrimination have been put in place through decisions by the Supreme Court.&#160;<br/>However, these decisions have focused on discrimination based on sex,140&#160;sexual orientation141&#160;and&#160;<br/>distributive justice,142&#160;and have not removed discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel that is based&#160;<br/>on their non-Jewish identity. This is due to a provision in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty that&#160;<br/>establishes the law’s purpose as one of protection of “human dignity and liberty, in order to establish in a&#160;<br/>Basic Law the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.”143&#160;However, under Article 8&#160;<br/>of the same Basic Law, the state’s Jewishness is a legal consideration that allows the state to limit the right&#160;<br/>
135.&#160;For a history of Israel’s perspective, see Jacob Tovy,&#160;<i>Israel and the Palestinian Refugee Issue: The Formulation of a Policy, 1948-1956</i>,&#160;<br/>
2014. For an example of a specific statement, see American Friends Service Committee&#160;(AFSC), Palestinian Refugees and the Right of&#160;<br/>
Return”,&#160;<a href="https://www.afsc.org/resource/palestinian-refugees-and-right-return#_edn9">afsc.org/resource/palestinian-refugees-and-right-return#_edn9</a>&#160;(accessed on 10 December 2021): “… during an August 9, 1949&#160;<br/>
meeting between AFSC employee Don Stevenson and Eliahu Elath, the Israeli Ambassador&#160;to the US… Stevenson asked Ambassador Elath&#160;<br/>
if Israel would accept the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes [and] Elath told him that Israel would not because ‘Israel would&#160;<br/>
commit suicide if she took back all the refugees.’” Amnesty International uses the term “Jewish state” following the terminology used by the&#160;<br/>
State of Israel since the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948. The existing legal construction&#160;of Jewish identity&#160;<br/>
as the sole national identity of the State of Israel was enshrined in the 2018 Basic Law: Israel the Nation State of Jewish&#160;People, which&#160;<br/>

<a name=65></a>to equality and violate other rights that are protected within the Basic Law.144&#160;Attempts to amend the Basic&#160;<br/>Laws to guarantee equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel have been unsuccessful, on the express grounds&#160;<br/>that such attempts “seek to deny Israel’s existence as the state of the Jewish people”.145&#160;<br/>
In 2018, Israel limited the right to equality and non-discrimination even further by enacting the 2018&#160;<br/>Basic Law: Israel the Nation State of the Jewish People (see box below).146&#160;The law enshrined the existing&#160;<br/>legal construction of Jewish identity as the sole national identity of the State of Israel. It expressly does not&#160;<br/>recognize any other national identity,147&#160;affirms that the right of self-determination is exclusive “to the Jewish&#160;<br/>people”,148&#160;and contains no protection of equality and non-discrimination.&#160;Instead, it protects and codifies&#160;<br/>pre-existing discriminatory legislation and policies, encapsulated in the most salient aspects of Israel’s&#160;<br/>regime of racial and national discrimination against not only its Palestinian citizens but also Palestinians&#160;<br/>residing in the OPT. Israeli law thus establishes a superior “Jewish nationality” status that is distinct from&#160;<br/>citizenship and the basis for differential treatment of Jewish and non-Jewish citizens.149&#160;<br/>
<b>BASIC LAW: ISRAEL THE NATION STATE OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE</b><br/>
On 19 July 2018, following extended debate, the Knesset passed Basic Law: Israel the Nation State&#160;<br/>of the Jewish People,150&#160;which for the first time enshrined Israel exclusively as the “nation state of the&#160;<br/>Jewish people” and constitutionally entrenched inequality and racial and national discrimination against&#160;<br/>Palestinian and other non-Jewish citizens of Israel. The law, known informally as the nation state law,&#160;<br/>is applicable to the territory of Israel and implicitly covers the OPT, especially under Article 7, which&#160;<br/>enshrines the development of “Jewish settlement” in Israel as the “historical homeland of the Jewish&#160;<br/>people”.151<br/>
The law declares: “The exercise of the right to national self-determination in the state of Israel is&#160;<br/>unique to the Jewish People” (Article 1). It also ascribes the symbols of the state, all of which are&#160;<br/>Jewish in character (Article 2), and defines Jerusalem as the united&#160;capital of Israel (Article 3). The&#160;<br/>law establishes Hebrew as the official language, while demoting the status of Arabic from an official&#160;<br/>language to one with “special status” (Article 4).&#160;<br/>
The nation state law reiterates that Israel “shall be open for Jewish immigration” (Article 5), and shall&#160;<br/>act, in the diaspora, to preserve the ties between the state and members of the Jewish people (Article&#160;<br/>

<a name=66></a>6), further enshrining the privileges granted to Jews in nationality and status under the Law of Return of&#160;<br/>1950 and the Nationality Law of 1952. Israel’s then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, during a&#160;<br/>cabinet meeting on 5 August 2018:&#160;<br/>
<i>The Nation-State Law, first of all, entrenches the Law of Return. It raises it to&#160;another level and&#160;<br/>this law, of course, grants an automatic right to Jews, and only to them, to come here and receive&#160;<br/>citizenship. The Nation-State Law, for example, prevents the exploitation of the family reunification&#160;<br/>clause under which very, very many Palestinians have been absorbed into the country since&#160;<br/>the Oslo agreement, and this law helps prevent the continued uncontrolled entry into Israel of&#160;<br/>Palestinians. It could be that this law will also be able to assist us in blocking the future entry&#160;<br/>of labor migrants… [W]ithout the Nation-State Law it will be impossible to ensure for [future]&#160;<br/>generations the future of Israel as a Jewish national state.152&#160;</i><br/>
Additionally, the law entrenched the racial and national discrimination in Israeli laws and policies&#160;<br/>related to land and resources, which are discussed in this report, by highlighting the importance of&#160;<br/>“the development of Jewish settlement as a national value” and asserting that the state “shall act to&#160;<br/>encourage and promote its establishment and strengthening” (Article&#160;7). This is the first time the term&#160;<br/>“Jewish settlement” appears in any Israeli legislation.153&#160;The development of Jewish settlement in the&#160;<br/>law also includes an underlying intention to develop Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.&#160;<br/>The Israeli government considers the settlements in the OPT as part of Israel and has channelled the&#160;<br/>application of Israeli law to both settlements and Jewish settlers in the OPT.154&#160;<br/>
The nation state law holds a binding constitutional status, which cannot&#160;be modified except by a Basic&#160;<br/>Law that is passed with a parliamentary majority of 61 Knesset members.&#160;<br/>
In 2019, both the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) and the UN&#160;<br/>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concerns regarding the&#160;<br/>“possible discriminatory effect” of the law with regard to the enjoyment of human rights in Israel by non-<br/>Jewish people. They called on Israel to review it in order to comply with its international human rights law&#160;<br/>obligations to eliminate discrimination against non-Jews.155&#160;The CESCR also called on Israel to consider&#160;<br/>repealing the law and to step up its efforts to eliminate discrimination in the enjoyment of economic,&#160;<br/>social and cultural rights, particularly the rights of self-determination and non-discrimination.156&#160;<br/>
In November 2020, the magistrates’ court in the Krayot, a cluster of towns near Haifa, rejected a&#160;<br/>petition for schoolchildren’s access to education by Palestinian citizens of Israel living in Karmiel,&#160;<br/>citing the nation state law. The decision said that establishing an Arabic school in the town&#160;<br/>or funding transport for its Palestinian residents to study in Arabic-medium schools in nearby&#160;<br/>communities would undermine the town’s “Jewish character”.157<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=67></a>In July 2021, the Supreme Court rejected 15 petitions, including ones submitted by the Joint List&#160;<br/>of four Palestinian-majority political parties and Meretz, another political party in Israel, as well as&#160;<br/>human rights groups such as Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel (Adalah)&#160;<br/>and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), to strike down the nation state law or any of its&#160;<br/>components.158<br/>
In parallel to the laws, policies and practices described above and in the rest of this chapter, statements by&#160;<br/>leading Israeli politicians over the years confirm that the intention to&#160;maintain a Jewish demographic majority&#160;<br/>and to oppress and dominate Palestinians has guided Israel’s policies since the state’s creation. In February&#160;<br/>1948, David Ben-Gurion, then chairperson of the Jewish Agency for Israel, the operative branch of the World&#160;<br/>Zionist Organization, before becoming prime minister, openly praised the use of unlawful means to forcibly&#160;<br/>and cruelly change the demographic composition of the country to the benefit of Jewish Israelis by expelling&#160;<br/>Palestinians and destroying their homes and properties. The night after visiting Lifta, a Palestinian village&#160;<br/>in the suburbs of Jerusalem that was completely emptied of Palestinians after they had been expelled from&#160;<br/>their homes and fled, he reported:<br/>
<i>When you enter the city through Lifta and Romema, through Mahaneh Yehuda, King George Street and&#160;<br/>Me’ah She’arim – there are no Arabs. One hundred per cent Jews… What happened in Jerusalem and&#160;<br/>in Haifa – can happen in large parts of the country. If we persist it is quite possible that in the next six or&#160;<br/>eight months there will be considerable changes in the country, very considerable and to our advantage.&#160;<br/>There will certainly be considerable changes in the demographic composition of the country.159</i><br/>
Since then, successive Israeli politicians – regardless of their political&#160;affiliations – have publicly stated their&#160;<br/>intention to minimize Palestinians’ access to and control of land across all territories under Israel’s effective&#160;<br/>control. They have carried this out by seizing Palestinians’ homes and properties and effectively restricting&#160;<br/>them to living in enclaves. When then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a message on Instagram&#160;<br/>in March 2019 to say that “Israel is not a state of all its citizens” but rather “the nation-state of the Jewish&#160;<br/>people and only them”,160&#160;he crystallized a policy that had been seven decades in the making.&#160;<br/>
Already in December 2003, when he was minister of finance, Benjamin Netanyahu said: “If there is a&#160;<br/>demographic problem, and there is, it is with the Israeli Arabs who will remain Israeli citizens.” He noted the&#160;<br/>need to balance policies that strove to integrate “Israel’s Arabs” while ensuring they did not reach 35% to&#160;<br/>40% of the population.161&#160;While Benjamin Netanyahu was criticized for his 2003 comments, they were not&#160;<br/>the views of an outlier. When prime minister between 1992 and 1995, Yitzhak Rabin said: “The red line for&#160;<br/>Arabs is 20 percent of the population; that must not be gone over.” He added: “I want to preserve the Jewish&#160;<br/>character of the state of Israel.”162&#160;Ehud Barak, when he was prime minister between 1999 and 2001,&#160;<br/>equated a “Muslim majority” with “destruction of Israel as a Jewish state”.163&#160;Ariel Sharon, as prime minister,&#160;<br/>said in a 2002 Knesset debate that while Palestinian citizens had “rights in the land”, “all rights over the land&#160;<br/>of Israel are Jewish rights”.164&#160;Ehud Olmert said in 2003, while vice prime minister and three years before he&#160;<br/>

<a name=68></a>became prime minister, that “the demographic issue” would “dictate the solution we must adopt” and that&#160;<br/>the “formula for the parameters of a unilateral solution are: to maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the&#160;<br/>number of Palestinians”.165<br/>
Statements by leading Israeli politicians make it apparent that the discriminatory intent to dominate&#160;<br/>Palestinians is not only manifested through control over land and dispossession but also through a separate&#160;<br/>and unequal citizenship structure and the denial of Palestinians’ right to family reunification. In 2005, then&#160;<br/>prime minister Ariel Sharon said when commenting on the renewal of the temporary and discriminatory&#160;<br/>2003 Citizenship and Entry Law (see section 5.3.1 “Denial of right to equal nationality and status”): “There’s&#160;<br/>no need to hide behind security arguments. There’s a need for the existence of a Jewish state.”166&#160;He&#160;<br/>later added that the authorities had “a correct and important intention of Israel being a Jewish state with&#160;<br/>a massive Jewish majority” and that “we must do everything so that this state remains a Jewish state in&#160;<br/>the future”.167&#160;Giora Eiland, a national security adviser who in 2005 served on a committee examining&#160;<br/>immigration policies, argued that the discriminatory Citizenship and Entry Law “is the way to overcome&#160;<br/>the demographic demon”.168&#160;The same year, Benjamin Netanyahu, while the finance minister, put it more&#160;<br/>directly during discussions over renewing the law: “Instead of making it easier for Palestinians who want&#160;<br/>to get citizenship, we should make the process much more difficult,&#160;in order to guarantee Israel’s security&#160;<br/>and a Jewish majority in Israel.”169&#160;Asher Grunis, then deputy president of the Supreme Court and later&#160;<br/>its president, rejected in 2012 a constitutional challenge to the discriminatory aspects of the 2003 Israel&#160;<br/>Citizenship and Entry Law, writing: “Human rights are not a prescription for national suicide.”170&#160;This view&#160;<br/>was echoed at the time by Eli Yishai, while serving as minister of interior affairs, who welcomed the Supreme&#160;<br/>Court’s decision, similarly stating that approving a larger number of&#160;family unification applications from the&#160;<br/>West Bank would constitute “national suicide”.171<br/>
Reporting on 2003 and 2004 statistics that showed a drop in the Israeli birth rate, primarily driven by a&#160;<br/>decline among Palestinian citizens of Israel, the Haaretz newspaper in January 2005 attributed to the&#160;<br/>finance ministry the view that “the drop of birth rate is a clear result&#160;of the cutbacks in child support&#160;<br/>allocations over the past two years”. Haaretz quoted a senior finance&#160;ministry official, who asked not to be&#160;<br/>named, citing the “internal demographic threat” and expressing concern over “the high birth rate of the&#160;<br/>Arabs, and especially the Negev Bedouin”. The official said, “we are&#160;reversing the graph, to defend the&#160;<br/>Jewish majority in the country,” and warned, according to Haaretz, that reinstating the allowance would lead&#160;<br/>to the state having to support large families in places like the Negev/Naqab region in southern Israel, which&#160;<br/>would have the effect of undermining the Jewish majority.172<br/>
The perception of Palestinians inside Israel as an internal demographic threat or enemies who must be&#160;<br/>either expelled, excluded or controlled has also shaped discriminatory housing and zoning policies in areas&#160;<br/>of strategic importance that include a large Palestinian population. For example, in December 2000 Ariel&#160;<br/>Sharon, just before he became prime minister, wrote:<br/>
<i>In the Negev, we face a serious problem: About 900,000 dunams of government land are not in our&#160;<br/>hands, but in the hands of the Bedouin population. I, as a resident of the Negev, see this problem&#160;</i><br/>

<a name=69></a><i>every day. It is, essentially, a demographic phenomenon… Out of weakness, perhaps also lack of&#160;<br/>awareness about the issue, we, as a country, are doing nothing to confront this situation… The&#160;<br/>Bedouin are grabbing new territory. They are gnawing away at the country’s land reserves, and no one&#160;<br/>is doing anything significant about it.173</i><br/>
The State of Israel, regardless of which party is in power, has continued the policy of dominating Palestinians&#160;<br/>through the seizure of lands and the segregation of Palestinian communities. As will be demonstrated in this&#160;<br/>chapter, this intention to seize the lands of the Bedouin, to make them homeless, and to replace them with&#160;<br/>Jewish Israelis, was implemented by Ariel Sharon as prime minister and continues to be implemented to this&#160;<br/>day (see section 5.4.4 “Discriminatory urban planning and zoning system”). In 2009, Israel’s housing minister&#160;<br/>Ariel Atias warned against “the spread” of Palestinian communities, saying, “if we go on like we have until&#160;<br/>now, we will lose the Galilee.”174&#160;At the same time deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon said, “we are losing&#160;<br/>the Negev and the Galilee”, and that “in many places there is no contiguous Jewish presence”, confirming&#160;<br/>that the government’s aim was “to Judaize the Negev and the Galilee”.175&#160;This corroborates the conclusion&#160;<br/>that can&#160;be&#160;inferred&#160;from the&#160;facts&#160;documented in&#160;this&#160;report&#160;that the&#160;restrictions&#160;on Palestinian&#160;communities&#160;<br/>inside Israel that lead to them living in enclaves are not accidental but the result of a deliberate policy of the&#160;<br/>Israeli government to control and dominate the Palestinian population&#160;to the benefit of Jewish Israelis.<br/>
Some Israeli politicians who have opposed settlements in parts of the West Bank have made clear their&#160;<br/>opposition is based on the fear that this will lead to enfranchisement of Palestinians there, which they see as&#160;<br/>a threat to the Jewish nature of the State of Israel. Shimon Peres, while serving as president in 2012, said,&#160;<br/>“Israeli settlements in [parts of the West Bank] densely populated with Arabs… can lead to a threatening&#160;<br/>demographic change” that “places a Jewish majority in the state of Israel at risk”.176<br/>
The intention to discriminate against and control the Palestinian population in the OPT through&#160;<br/>discriminatory land, planning and housing policies is equally clear. Since 1967, successive Israeli&#160;<br/>governments have repeatedly indicated their intention to preserve a Jewish demographic majority in&#160;<br/>Jerusalem through planning policies, laws and measures in the city.177&#160;The first geo-demographic dilemma&#160;<br/>facing Israel as an occupying power arose with the decision to redraw the new Jerusalem boundaries and&#160;<br/>the areas that would be de facto annexed in 1967, as the new annexed area included Palestinian villages&#160;<br/>and communities way beyond the boundaries of the Jordanian-ruled East Jerusalem municipality. Some&#160;<br/>Israeli officials criticized the annexation on 27 June 1967, saying the&#160;demographic “price” was high because&#160;<br/>the number of Palestinians in the expanded municipality would affect the city’s demographic ratio of Jews&#160;<br/>to Palestinians.178&#160;As noted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, an independent research institute&#160;<br/>specializing in public diplomacy and foreign policy, “The main consideration guiding the decision makers&#160;<br/>was to take control over the maximum area with a minimal Arab population and to prevent the possibility of&#160;<br/>the city’s partition in the future.”179<br/>
In 1975, Israel Kimhi, then director of planning policy at the Interior Ministry, said that “one of the&#160;<br/>cornerstones in the planning of Jerusalem is the demographic question” and that preservation of a Jewish&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=70></a>majority would serve as “one of the yardsticks for the success of the&#160;solidification of Jerusalem’s status as&#160;<br/>the capital of Israel”.180&#160;In June 1984, Teddy Kollek, then mayor of Jerusalem, expressed his concerns on&#160;<br/>this question, saying: “Like all of us here, it seems to me, I am worried about the balance of power and Arab&#160;<br/>growth within and around Jerusalem.”181<br/>
Since the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem, Israeli governments have set targets for the demographic&#160;<br/>ratio of Jews to Palestinians in Jerusalem as a whole. Successive Israeli government decisions endorsed&#160;<br/>a target ratio of 70% to 30%. In 2006, the target was revised to 65% to 35% within the framework of the&#160;<br/>regional zoning plan 30/1. In 2009, a new target of 60% Jews to 40% Palestinians, which was set in the&#160;<br/>“Jerusalem 2000” Local Outline Plan, was deposited with the Regional Planning Committee.182&#160;Whereas the&#160;<br/>demographic increase of the Palestinian population of Jerusalem was based on natural growth, the Jewish&#160;<br/>demographic growth would be primarily from internal migration and absorption of Jewish immigrants.183<br/>
Statements by Israeli politicians suggest also that the denial of economic and social rights to Palestinians in&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem is not merely a consequence of Israel’s dispossession and segregation policies but rather that&#160;<br/>it is intentional. For example, Teddy Kollek, then mayor of Jerusalem, said in 1990:<br/>
<i>For&#160;Jewish&#160;Jerusalem,&#160;I&#160;did&#160;something&#160;in&#160;the&#160;past&#160;twenty-five&#160;years.&#160;For&#160;East&#160;Jerusalem?&#160;Nothing!&#160;What&#160;<br/>did I do? Nothing. Sidewalks? Nothing. Cultural institutions? Not one.&#160;Yes, we installed a sewerage&#160;<br/>system for them and improved the water supply. Do you know why?&#160;Do you think it was for their good,&#160;<br/>for their welfare? Forget it! There were some cases of cholera there,&#160;and the Jews were afraid that they&#160;<br/>would catch it, so we installed sewerage and a water system against cholera.184</i><br/>
Meanwhile, in the rest of the West Bank, already on 7 July 1967, only one month after the Israeli army&#160;<br/>occupied the West Bank, Israel’s then prime minister Levi Eshkol said, “The security and the land are in&#160;<br/>Israeli hands.”185&#160;In a meeting of the Labor Party, which he led, that year, he stated that authorities “covet&#160;<br/>the dowry, not the bride”, an apparent reference to wanting the West Bank without the Palestinians who live&#160;<br/>there.186&#160;In 1996, shortly after becoming Israel’s prime minister and during a visit to Ariel settlement, located&#160;<br/>in the north of the West Bank with nearly 20,000 settlers,187&#160;Benjamin Netanyahu declared that settlements&#160;<br/>were “permanently forever”.188<br/>
The intention to control the lands and territories of the West Bank to the exclusive benefit of Jewish Israelis,&#160;<br/>and with the express exclusion of Palestinians, continues. In 2014, member of Knesset (MK) Yariv Levin,&#160;<br/>appointed the following year as Israel’s minister of&#160;<i>aliyah</i>&#160;(Jewish immigration) and integration, said:&#160;<br/>
<i>The correct policy, from the point of view of Israeli interests regarding our political ability at the moment,&#160;<br/>is to combine the attempt to hold the maximum amount of territory and apply sovereignty over the&#160;<br/>maximum amount of territory while keeping the Arab population within it to a minimum. The situation&#160;<br/>already exists in Area C, which is under our control – there are little more than fifty thousand Arabs.189&#160;&#160;</i><br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
70<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a>Prior to national elections in May 2019, then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to annex Israeli&#160;<br/>settlements in the West Bank, stating: “I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement&#160;<br/>blocs and isolated settlements.” He added: “From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and&#160;<br/>we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty&#160;<br/>to the Palestinians.”190&#160;Two months later, he publicly revealed Israel’s intention to continue to control the&#160;<br/>entirety of Israel and the OPT: “Israeli military and security forces will continue to rule the entire territory,&#160;<br/>up to the Jordan [River].”191&#160;Further, when speaking about plans to annex the Jordan Valley, in May 2020,&#160;<br/>he stated that “Palestinians have to recognize that we are dictating security rules over the entire territory,”&#160;<br/>describing Jericho residents as “subjects”.&#160;192<br/>
The proposals to annex the Jordan Valley to Israel are not new. In fact, such plans were advanced at the&#160;<br/>outset of the occupation in 1967 in the Allon Plan, named after Yigal Allon, the then minister of labour.&#160;<br/>Its main objective was to ensure “Jewish presence” and avoid annexing areas densely populated by&#160;<br/>Palestinians.193<br/>
Israel’s intention to control Palestinians in the West Bank to facilitate the seizure of their land is also apparent&#160;<br/>in statements by Israeli leaders over the decades. For example, in a July 1981 meeting of the Ministerial&#160;<br/>Committee for Settlement Affairs, then minister of agriculture Ariel Sharon justified designating additional&#160;<br/>land in the West Bank as military “firing zones” by citing the “spreading of&#160;Arab villagers” in the South&#160;<br/>Hebron Hills, according to minutes of the meeting found in the Israeli State Archives by the Akevot Institute&#160;<br/>for Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Research, an NGO that conducts archival research. Ariel Sharon added, “We&#160;<br/>have an interest in expanding and enlarging the shooting zones there, in order to keep these areas, which&#160;<br/>are so vital, in our hands.”194&#160;In February 2021, Avi Naim, who served as director-general for Israel’s Ministry&#160;<br/>for Settlement Affairs between July and October 2020, underscored the government’s objective to “prevent&#160;<br/>Palestinian territorial continuity” and “keep control of land reserves in Judea and Samaria”, a reference&#160;<br/>to the Israeli government-designated administrative territory that encompasses the occupied West Bank&#160;<br/>excluding East Jerusalem.195<br/>
Further, Israeli politicians have made it clear that the OPT would not&#160;be allowed to develop for the benefit of&#160;<br/>Palestinians.&#160;For example,&#160;in 1985,&#160;then defence minister&#160;Yitzhak Rabin said, “There will&#160;be no development&#160;<br/>[for Palestinians in the OPT] initiated by the Israeli Government, and no permits will be given for expanding&#160;<br/>agriculture or industry [there], which may compete with the State of Israel.”196<br/>
Israel’s withdrawal of its settlers from Gaza, while it maintained control over the people in the territory in other&#160;<br/>ways, was also expressly linked to demographic questions, and a realization that a Jewish majority could&#160;<br/>not be achieved there. On 15 August 2005, the day the Israeli government set as a deadline for settlers to&#160;<br/>voluntarily leave Gaza, then prime minister Ariel Sharon said in an evening address to Israelis, “Gaza cannot&#160;<br/>be held onto forever. Over one million Palestinians live there, and they double their numbers with every&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=72></a>generation.”197&#160;The same month, then deputy prime minister Shimon Peres said, “We are disengaging from&#160;<br/>Gaza because of demography.”198<br/>
Meanwhile, as Israel prepared to withdraw from Gaza it also increased efforts to dispossess Palestinians in&#160;<br/>the Galilee and the Negev/Naqab – both areas with a large Palestinian population. Haaretz quoted an adviser&#160;<br/>to Ariel Sharon as saying in 2003 that the then prime minister “reached the conclusion that following the&#160;<br/>enormous investment in settling the territories, it is now necessary to settle the Galilee and the Negev.”199&#160;<br/>
Finally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website make it obvious that Israel’s long-standing policy to deprive&#160;<br/>millions of Palestinian refugees of their right to return to their homes is also guided by demographic&#160;<br/>considerations. An article published in 2001 explains: “If Israel were to allow all of [the refugees] to return to&#160;<br/>her territory, this would be an act of suicide on her part, and no state can be expected to destroy itself.”200&#160;<br/>
<b>5.1.1 PALESTINIANS AND JEWISH ISRAELIS AS RACIAL GROUPS<br/></b>The question of race and the existence of racial groups is a fraught one, but one that must be engaged with&#160;<br/>to understand the international wrong that is apartheid.&#160;<br/>
Any attempt at racial categorization is distasteful and complicated, since perceived racial differences often&#160;<br/>coincide with other grounds of differentiation such as religion, culture and nationality. For the purpose of this&#160;<br/>report, we consider the modern conception of race under international criminal law as primarily a subjective&#160;<br/>one, dependant on the perception of the groups but especially that of the alleged perpetrators. The&#160;<br/>overriding question here is therefore whether Israel, in its law and practice, and individual Israeli politicians&#160;<br/>and officials, in their actions maintaining domination, consider and treat Jewish Israelis and Palestinians as&#160;<br/>separate racial groups. This report demonstrates that Jewish Israelis and Palestinians self-identify as different&#160;<br/>groups, and crucially that the laws of Israel perceive and treat Palestinians as a separate and inferior group.&#160;<br/>
The understanding of the existence of two distinct groups is implicit&#160;in findings by CERD, which has&#160;<br/>expressed concerns with regards to the nation state law of 2018. It stated that Israel maintains segregation&#160;<br/>both in Israel and in the OPT, including segregation among “Jewish and non-Jewish sectors”. In Israel, this&#160;<br/>is manifested through two systems of education with unequal conditions, as well as separate municipalities,&#160;<br/>namely Jewish municipalities and the so-called “municipalities of the minorities”. In the OPT, segregation&#160;<br/>results in the existence of “two entirely separate legal systems and sets of institutions for Jewish communities&#160;<br/>in illegal settlements on the one hand and Palestinian populations living in Palestinian towns and villages on&#160;<br/>the other hand.”201<br/>
In its 2019 review of Israel, the CESCR called on Israel to amend and/or repeal the nation state law of 2018,&#160;<br/>noting the “possible discriminatory effect [of the law]… on non-Jewish people”, and to step up its efforts to&#160;<br/>eliminate discrimination faced by non-Jews in their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and&#160;<br/>rights to non-discrimination and self-determination.202<br/>
As a matter of legal fact, Jewish Israelis form a group that is unified by&#160;a privileged legal status embedded&#160;<br/>in Israeli law, which extends to them through state services and protections regardless of where they reside&#160;<br/>across the territories under Israel’s effective control. The Jewish identity of the State of Israel has been&#160;<br/>established in its laws and the practice of its official and national institutions. Israeli laws perceive and&#160;<br/>treat Jewish identity, depending on the context, as a religious, descent-based, and/or of national or ethnic&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

<a name=73></a>identity.203&#160;An example of the overlap between race, religion and descent is evident in Israel’s Law of Return,&#160;<br/>which defines “Jew” to include “a person who was born of a Jewish&#160;mother”.204&#160;&#160;<br/>
Palestinians on the other hand are treated by the Israeli state differently based on its consideration of them&#160;<br/>as having a racialized non-Jewish, Arab status and, beyond that, as being part of a group with particular&#160;<br/>attributes that are different from other non-Jewish groups. With respect to Palestinian citizens of Israel, the&#160;<br/>Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially classifies them as being “Arab citizens of Israel”, an inclusive term&#160;<br/>that describes a number of different and primarily Arabic-speaking groups, including Muslim Arabs (this&#160;<br/>classification includes Bedouins), Christian Arabs, Druze and Circassians.205&#160;However, in public discourse,&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities and media generally refer only to Muslim Arabs and Christian Arabs – those who generally&#160;<br/>self-identify as Palestinians – as Israeli Arabs and associate them with Palestinians living in the OPT and&#160;<br/>beyond, using the specific terms Druze and Circassians for those other&#160;non-Jewish groups. The authorities&#160;<br/>also clearly consider Palestinian citizens of Israel as a single group different from Druze and Circassians&#160;<br/>since they exempt this group alone from military service in “consideration for their family, religious, and&#160;<br/>cultural affiliations with the Arab world (which has subjected Israel to frequent attacks), as well as concern&#160;<br/>over possible dual loyalties.”206<br/>
As will be demonstrated in the subsequent sections of this chapter, Israeli law, policy and practices, as&#160;<br/>exercised differently but consistently in all areas and in all situations under its control, privilege those&#160;<br/>identified as Jewish Israelis and discriminate against, exclude and segregate those identified as non-Jewish&#160;<br/>people, in general, and, to the deepest extent, those considered as Palestinians. This status is treated in&#160;<br/>practice as an immutable characteristic. For example, while Israel recognizes conversion to Judaism,207&#160;and&#160;<br/>establishes mechanisms to give effect to such conversion,208&#160;in practice the state rejects all applications by&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel on the basis of “ethnicity” or “security”.209&#160;&#160;<br/>
Palestinians who live or have family origins in the territory of British mandate Palestine perceive their&#160;<br/>Palestinian identity primarily as one of national origin210&#160;(and as part of the Arab people).211&#160;There is currently&#160;<br/>no Palestinian citizenship, although it was formally recognized under the British mandate.212<br/>
Regardless of whether individual Palestinians are citizens of Israel living in Israel, or Palestinians living&#160;<br/>under Israeli military rule in the OPT, or Palestinian refugees, they overwhelmingly regard themselves as&#160;<br/>

<a name=74></a>Palestinian and have deep and shared political, ethnic, social and cultural ties.213&#160;Palestinians share a&#160;<br/>common language and have similar customs and cultural practices, despite having different religions,&#160;<br/>regardless of the territory in which they reside.214&#160;Palestinian refugees currently living elsewhere may, and&#160;<br/>often do, have genuine links to their host states but this does not diminish or reduce their self-identification&#160;<br/>as Palestinians.215&#160;The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) defines Palestinians as “Arab nationals who,&#160;<br/>until 1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were evicted from it or have stayed&#160;<br/>there,” and considers that this Palestinian nationality is transmitted to children, regardless of whether their&#160;<br/>parents reside inside or outside of Palestine.216<br/>
As will be demonstrated in the subsequent sections of this chapter, Israeli law, policy and practices, as&#160;<br/>exercised differently but consistently in all areas and in all situations under its control, privilege those&#160;<br/>identified as Jewish Israelis and discriminate against, exclude and segregate Palestinians. This evidence&#160;<br/>demonstrates that the State of Israel perceives Palestinians as “different and… inferior… on account&#160;<br/>of particular… cultural attributes.”217&#160;Considering the definition of “racial group” under international&#160;<br/>criminal law,218&#160;which emphasizes identification and the intent of the alleged&#160;perpetrators, Jewish Israelis&#160;<br/>and Palestinians constitute racial groups for the purposes of customary international law, the ICERD, the&#160;<br/>Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute.&#160;<br/>
<b>5.2 FRAGMENTATION INTO DOMAINS OF CONTROL<br/></b>At the beginning of 1948, Palestinians constituted a majority in British mandate Palestine, comprising some&#160;<br/>1.2 million out of a population of some 2 million, and owning about 90% of the privately owned land in the&#160;<br/>territory.219&#160;During the 1947-49 conflict before and after the May 1948 declaration of the State of Israel,&#160;<br/>hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly displaced in what amounted to ethnic cleansing. Some&#160;<br/>were internally displaced from their villages, towns and cities to other parts of what became Israel. Others&#160;<br/>fled to different parts of what was then British mandate Palestine (22% of which fell under the control&#160;<br/>of Jordan and Egypt following the 1947-49 conflict – what is now the&#160;OPT). Most of the rest fled to the&#160;<br/>neighbouring Arab countries of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.220&#160;Israel prevents these Palestinian refugees, and&#160;<br/>their descendants, as well as internally displaced persons within Israel, from returning to their former places&#160;<br/>of residence (see section 5.2.3 “Palestinians outside Israel and OPT”).&#160;<br/>
Palestinians became fragmented even further after the June 1967 war, which resulted in Israel’s military&#160;<br/>occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, the creation of a separate legal&#160;<br/>and administrative regime to control the occupied territories, and another wave of Palestinian displacement –&#160;<br/>from areas that became known as the OPT.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=75></a>The new military regime in the OPT was established on top of a pre-existing multi-layered legal system made&#160;<br/>up of Ottoman, British, Jordanian (in the West Bank) and Egyptian (in Gaza) laws – the legacy of the powers&#160;<br/>that had previously controlled the area.221&#160;Since then, the Israeli authorities have issued hundreds of military&#160;<br/>orders that continue to govern many aspects of Palestinian life in the OPT today including access to land&#160;<br/>and natural resources as well as the rights to freedom of assembly, expression and movement. These orders,&#160;<br/>however, do not apply to Palestinians in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in 1967, and nor do they&#160;<br/>apply to Israeli settlers living in the occupied West Bank, who are afforded the same rights and protections&#160;<br/>under Israeli civil and criminal law as other Jewish Israeli citizens. By contrast, Palestinians in the West Bank&#160;<br/>are subjected to a military court system, which falls short of international standards for the fair conduct of&#160;<br/>trials and administration of justice.&#160;<br/>
In 1994, the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO created the Palestinian Authority and granted&#160;<br/>it limited control over Palestinian civil affairs in urban centres, but failed to end the occupation. The&#160;<br/>establishment of the Palestinian Authority and the admission of Palestine as a non-member observer state&#160;<br/>at the UN General Assembly in 2012 did not change the status of the OPT under international law. Nor&#160;<br/>was this status changed by the withdrawal of Israeli settlers living illegally in Gaza in 2005. The entirety&#160;<br/>of the West Bank and Gaza Strip remains under Israeli military occupation, with Israel retaining effective&#160;<br/>control over these territories, including the Palestinian population living there, their natural resources and,&#160;<br/>with the exception of Gaza’s short southern border with Egypt, their land and sea borders and airspace.222&#160;<br/>As a result, two sets of complementary legal frameworks continue to apply to the conduct of Israel, as&#160;<br/>the occupying power with effective control over the OPT: international human rights law and international&#160;<br/>humanitarian law.&#160;<br/>
However, while preserving the OPT’s status as occupied territory under international law, the Oslo Accords&#160;<br/>have added another layer of administrative and legal complexity to the governance of Palestinians in&#160;<br/>the OPT, fragmenting and segregating them even further to Israel’s benefit,223&#160;while internal Palestinian&#160;<br/>political divisions have exacerbated this separation even further. Today, Palestinians in the OPT live under&#160;<br/>separate jurisdictions and require permits from the Israeli authorities to cross between them – from and to&#160;<br/>the Gaza Strip, annexed East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank and– and are also separated from&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel, both geographically and on the basis of their status. Meanwhile, Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees displaced during the 1947-49 and 1967 conflicts continue to be physically isolated from those&#160;<br/>residing in Israel and the OPT through Israel’s continuous denial of their right to return to their homes,&#160;<br/>towns and villages.<br/>
This section focuses on Israel’s role in fragmenting the Palestinian population between Israel, the OPT and&#160;<br/>neighbouring countries and the resulting situation for Palestinians in each of these areas, as determined by&#160;<br/>successive historical events.&#160;<br/>
<b>5.2.1 PALESTINIANS IN ISRAEL<br/></b>Early proponents of a state of Israel stated that they would establish a Jewish national home without&#160;<br/>undermining the rights of the native population,224&#160;but this did not come to pass. Instead, as mentioned&#160;<br/>above, the establishment of a Jewish state led to the mass expulsion of more than 800,000 Palestinians.225&#160;&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=76></a>The number of Palestinians who remained in what became Israel in May 1948 was about 150,000,226&#160;out&#160;<br/>of a total population of some 1.2 million non-Jews, mostly Palestinians, counted by the UN in 1946.227&#160;They&#160;<br/>became entitled to Israeli citizenship under Israel’s Nationality Law of 1952.228&#160;However, from 1948 to 1966,&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel were arbitrarily placed under military administration in Israel, with their fate&#160;<br/>subordinated to the needs and interests of Jewish immigrants and Israeli security considerations (see section&#160;<br/>5.3.4 “Use of military rule”).229&#160;Even though they regained their freedom of movement and other rights&#160;<br/>after the military rule over them ended in 1966, they continue to be subjected to a system of oppression&#160;<br/>and domination through discriminatory policies that affect their legal status, access to land, resources and&#160;<br/>services, and ultimately their human development (see sections 5.3 “Segregation and control” and 5.4&#160;<br/>“Dispossession of land and property”).&#160;<br/>
According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS), at the end of December 2019 there were 6.7&#160;<br/>million Jews, comprising 74% of the population in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem; 1.9 million Arabs,&#160;<br/>including citizens and permanent residents of Israel, comprising 21% of the population; and 448,000 others&#160;<br/>(non-Arab Christians and people not classified by religion), comprising nearly 5% of the population.230<br/>
As mentioned above, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that “Arab citizens of Israel” is an inclusive&#160;<br/>term that describes a number of different and primarily Arabic-speaking groups, including Muslim Arabs&#160;<br/>(this classification includes Bedouins), Christian Arabs, Druze and Circassians.231&#160;According to the ICBS, at&#160;<br/>the end of 2019, the Druze population stood at approximately 145,000,232&#160;while according to the Ministry of&#160;<br/>Foreign Affairs, the Circassian population totalled 4,000 people.233&#160;Considering the number of those defined&#160;<br/>as Muslim Arabs and Christian Arabs together, the population of Palestinian citizens of Israel amounted to&#160;<br/>around 1.8 million, that is some 20% of the total population in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem.<br/>
Today, about 90% of Palestinian citizens of Israel live in 139 densely populated towns and villages in the&#160;<br/>Galilee and Triangle regions in northern Israel and the Negev/Naqab region in the south. The remaining&#160;<br/>10% live in “mixed cities”, including Haifa, Ramla, Lod, Jaffa and Acre. As will be seen below, this has&#160;<br/>been the result of deliberate policies by the government of Israel to segregate Palestinian citizens of Israel&#160;<br/>into enclaves as part of the wider goal of ensuring the Jewish settlement and control of as much of Israel’s&#160;<br/>territory as possible.&#160;<br/>
<b>5.2.2 PALESTINIANS IN OPT<br/></b>Following the 1967 war, Israel extended its control by means of military occupation to the Palestinian&#160;<br/>territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Together, these areas are&#160;<br/>known today as the OPT. Israel has administered these territories in different ways. It has unilaterally (and&#160;<br/>unlawfully under international law) annexed East Jerusalem, and the Israeli military has governed the rest of&#160;<br/>the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as occupied territories. The 1967 war also resulted in the occupation of&#160;<br/>the Golan Heights, belonging to Syria, and the Sinai peninsula, belonging to Egypt. Approximately 350,000&#160;<br/>refugees were displaced from these newly occupied areas, most of whom were Palestinians.234&#160;Of these&#160;<br/>

<a name=77></a>refugees, 117,000 had already been registered with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees&#160;<br/>in the Near East (UNRWA), the UN agency mandated to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees, between 1947 and 1952.235&#160;Jordan received about 200,000 Palestinians, of whom some 24,600&#160;<br/>returned to the OPT in the decades that followed.236&#160;The vast majority of Palestinian refugees from 1967&#160;<br/>and their descendants are prevented from returning to their former places of residence (see section 5.2.3&#160;<br/>“Palestinians outside Israel and OPT”).&#160;<br/>
<b>EAST JERUSALEM&#160;<br/></b>In 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem and included Palestinian parts of the city, as well&#160;<br/>as a surrounding area of 64km2, within the boundaries of the Israeli Jerusalem Municipality.237&#160;The&#160;<br/>new municipal boundaries of Jerusalem formed an area of 70km2&#160;and its eastern part was nearly&#160;<br/>12 times larger than the former East Jerusalem municipal area under Jordanian rule. The additional&#160;<br/>lands belonged to about 28 Palestinian villages from surrounding areas, with the new boundaries&#160;<br/>being delineated to ensure the inclusion of the maximum amount of land with the minimum number&#160;<br/>of Palestinians.238<br/>
On 27 June 1967, Israel passed Amendment 11 to the Law and Administration Ordinance of 1967,&#160;<br/>which provided that the “law, jurisdiction and administration” of Israel shall be extended to any&#160;<br/>area designated by a government decree.239&#160;The next day, Israel passed the Law and Administration&#160;<br/>Decree (No. 1) of 1967, under which it extended its law, jurisdiction and administration to the&#160;<br/>annexed 70km2&#160;of East Jerusalem and surrounding areas.240&#160;In 1980, the Israeli Knesset (parliament)&#160;<br/>passed the Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel, declaring Jerusalem as the “complete and united”&#160;<br/>capital of Israel. The law declares that the jurisdiction of Jerusalem includes all the areas annexed to&#160;<br/>the municipality in 1967 under the Law and Administration Decree (No. 1) of 1967.241&#160;The law further&#160;<br/>prohibits the transfer of the authority of the State of Israel or the Jerusalem Municipality to a foreign&#160;<br/>body.242&#160;On 1 January 2018, the Knesset adopted a second amendment to the Basic Law: Jerusalem,&#160;<br/>Capital of Israel, which required a vote by an increased majority of at least 80 (out of 120) Knesset&#160;<br/>members to make any changes to Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem.243&#160;The approved amendment did&#160;<br/>not include a clause on redrawing the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem that had been added in a&#160;<br/>previous draft and would have enabled the Israeli government to remove Palestinian neighbourhoods&#160;<br/>located beyond the fence/wall (the construction of which began in mid-2002) from the municipal&#160;<br/>boundaries of Jerusalem.244<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=78></a>As of July 2021, there were 358,800 Palestinian residents within the boundaries of the Jerusalem&#160;<br/>Municipality, comprising 38% of the city’s population.245&#160;Around 150,000 of them live in areas&#160;<br/>segregated from the rest of the city by the fence/wall and other military checkpoints. In order to&#160;<br/>maintain a Jewish majority and domination over Jerusalem, Israeli authorities have systematically&#160;<br/>conducted mass land expropriation to build Jewish settlements while applying discriminatory and&#160;<br/>restrictive policies against Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, mainly through zoning and planning&#160;<br/>policies. These severely impede Palestinian urban and demographic growth and the development&#160;<br/>of their neighbourhoods, with dire impacts on the enjoyment of socio-economic rights for the local&#160;<br/>Palestinian population.<br/>
Palestinians living in the annexed East Jerusalem area who were present at the time of the 1967&#160;<br/>census conducted by the Israeli army – around 69,000 people – were given the status of “permanent&#160;<br/>residency” as per the Entry into Israel Law of 1952. As “permanent residents”, Palestinians in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem are entitled to similar rights enjoyed by citizens of Israel, except the right to vote in the&#160;<br/>national legislative elections. In practice, however, they face discrimination in all aspects of their lives.&#160;<br/>The Ministry of Interior can easily revoke residency status, unlike citizenship (see sections 5.3.1&#160;<br/>“Denial of right to equal nationality and status” and 5.5.3 “Discriminatory provision of services”).&#160;<br/>
Israel maintains and expands settlements in East Jerusalem and allows 225,178 Israeli settlers to live&#160;<br/>in 13 settlements,246&#160;which are illegal under international law.247<br/>
The status of East Jerusalem as occupied territory under international law was not altered by Israel’s&#160;<br/>unilateral annexation of it, or by the US government’s recognition of the annexation in 2017.248&#160;Israeli&#160;<br/>settlements are deemed illegal under international humanitarian law, and condemned as illegal by&#160;<br/>most states and international bodies, including the UN Security Council.249<br/>
<b>REST OF WEST BANK &#160;<br/></b>In September 1967, just a few months into the start of its occupation, Israel began constructing&#160;<br/>settlements in the occupied West Bank, moving Jewish citizens into them and applying its civil law&#160;<br/>to them.250&#160;There are currently more than 441,600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank excluding East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem.251&#160;Their presence is illegal under international law.252&#160;They live in 132 settlements that&#160;<br/>have been officially established by the Israeli government, as well as 140 unauthorized outposts&#160;<br/>

overwhelmingly adopted Resolution A/ES-10/L.22 on the status of Jerusalem. The resolution reaffirmed that all “decisions and actions&#160;<br/>
which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are&#160;<br/>
null and void and must be rescinded”, thereby echoing UNSC Resolution 478 (1980) and calling on all states to refrain from establishing&#160;<br/>
diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. UNGA, Resolution ES-10/19: Status of Jerusalem, adopted on 21 December 2017, UN Doc. A/RES/ES-<br/>

conflict” and emphasized member states’ commitments under Article 2 of the UN Charter. UNSC Resolution 242 (1967), adopted on 22&#160;<br/>
November 1967, UN Doc. S/RES/242. In 1980 the UNSC adopted a resolution that further provided that “all legislative and administrative&#160;<br/>
measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City&#160;<br/>
of Jerusalem, and in particular the recent ‘basic law’ on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith”. UNSC&#160;Resolution&#160;<br/>
478 (1980), adopted on 20 August 1980, UN Doc. S/RES/478. Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly states that,&#160;in the&#160;<br/>

<a name=79></a>that have been established since the 1990s without government approval and are considered illegal&#160;<br/>even under Israeli law.253&#160;Approximately 3 million Palestinians live in the same territory.254<br/>
&#160;In 1981, Israel established the Civil Administration, a military unit that oversees all civilian matters&#160;<br/>for Jewish Israeli settlers and Palestinian residents in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem, such&#160;<br/>as zoning and building permits.255&#160;It also has powers over administrative matters for Palestinians in&#160;<br/>the OPT, including the population registry; travel and work permits; archaeology and nature reserves;&#160;<br/>natural resources management; agriculture; trade and industry; and environmental protection.256&#160;&#160;<br/>
Between 1993 and 1995, negotiations between Israel and the PLO led to a series of agreements,&#160;<br/>known as the Oslo Accords, between the two parties. These established the Palestinian Authority&#160;<br/>and divided the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem and Hebron) into Areas A, B and C. The Oslo&#160;<br/>Accords transferred limited and nominal jurisdiction of some civil affairs (such as health, education&#160;<br/>and internal security) to the Palestinian Authority, but Areas A, B and C have all effectively remained&#160;<br/>under overall Israeli control and continue to be militarily occupied. Israel gave the Palestinian Authority&#160;<br/>varying degrees of administrative responsibility over Areas A and B. These two areas include Palestinian&#160;<br/>towns and villages where 90% of the Palestinian population live (around 2.8 million people). Meanwhile,&#160;<br/>Palestinian rural areas were classified as Area C, comprising about 60% of the West Bank, subjected to&#160;<br/>full Israeli civil and security authority, and are today home to around 300,000 Palestinians in addition&#160;<br/>to almost all of the 441,600 Israeli settlers living in the occupied West Bank excluding East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>A separate agreement saw the division of the city of Hebron into Palestinian- and Israeli-administered&#160;<br/>sectors, known respectively as H1 and H2.257&#160;Some 700 Israeli settlers live in H2.258&#160;The Oslo Accords&#160;<br/>were intended to act as a “transitional arrangement” lasting&#160;not more than five years until further&#160;<br/>negotiations of a final agreement. However, its terms and implications remain in force today.259&#160;<br/>
In April 2020, Israel’s coalition government formed by then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#160;<br/>and his political rival Benny Gantz agreed to start the domestic process of annexing, in violation of&#160;<br/>international law, parts of the occupied West Bank that include Israeli settlements and the area known&#160;<br/>as the Jordan Valley.260&#160;On 13 August 2020, following a deal with the United Arab Emirates, brokered&#160;<br/>by the USA, Israel declared in a joint statement by the three countries that it “will suspend declaring&#160;<br/>sovereignty” in the West Bank and instead “focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries&#160;<br/>in the Arab and Muslim world.”261&#160;Although the annexation plan has been suspended, it offered further&#160;<br/>evidence of Israel’s intent to maintain control over Palestinians in the West Bank.262<br/>

<a name=80></a><b>GAZA STRIP &#160;<br/></b>Israel seized control of the Gaza Strip from Egypt in June 1967 and the Israeli military governed it as&#160;<br/>occupied territory from 1967 onwards. Following the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority gained&#160;<br/>limited jurisdiction over the Gaza Strip, but that did not change its status as occupied territory under&#160;<br/>international law.263&#160;Some 2 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip today; of these, some 1.4 million&#160;<br/>(over 70% of the population) are registered refugees with UNRWA.<br/>
In 2005, as part of what it termed “disengagement” from the Gaza Strip, Israel dismantled its 21&#160;<br/>settlements and removed some 8,000 settlers, who then mainly moved to settlements in the West&#160;<br/>Bank, and redeployed its ground troops. However, the Israeli army has retained effective control over&#160;<br/>Gaza. In 2007, following Hamas’s victory in parliamentary elections the previous year and the infighting&#160;<br/>among the Palestinian political factions, the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority suspended operations of&#160;<br/>its security forces and official institutions in Gaza while Hamas established a parallel security and law&#160;<br/>enforcement apparatus there.<br/>
Following Hamas’s takeover, Israel declared the Gaza Strip a “hostile entity”, citing security concerns,&#160;<br/>and imposed an air, land and sea blockade on it, preventing any movement of people or goods in or&#160;<br/>out of Gaza by air or sea.264&#160;<br/>
Since then, Israel has also restricted the entry of goods and fuel supplies into Gaza and used&#160;<br/>“mathematical formulas” to determine how much food to allow into Gaza, limited to what is deemed&#160;<br/>“essential for the survival of the civilian population”.265&#160;Israel has also severely restricted movement of&#160;<br/>people from Gaza to the West Bank to “exceptional humanitarian cases”.<br/>
For 14 years, Israeli authorities have isolated Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip from the rest of the&#160;<br/>OPT and Israel through a “separation policy”, as it has been termed by a number of Israeli officials.266&#160;<br/>During a parliamentary question regarding the official status of&#160;the separation policy in 2014, then&#160;<br/>deputy defence minister Danny Danon said:&#160;<br/>
<i>Starting in the summer of 2007, following the takeover of the Gaza Strip by terrorist organizations,&#160;<br/>Israel has been implementing a separation policy between the Gaza Strip and Judea and Samaria&#160;<br/>[West Bank excluding East Jerusalem]. This policy is backed by the decisions of the Government&#160;<br/>of Israel.267</i><br/>
This status was confirmed in March 2019 by then prime minister&#160;Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated&#160;<br/>that “maintaining a separation policy between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in&#160;<br/>Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state”.268&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=81></a><b>5.2.3 PALESTINIANS OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND OPT<br/></b>During the 1947-49 conflict, more than 800,000 Palestinians (who were citizens of British mandate&#160;<br/>Palestine) were expelled or fled from Israel and became refugees in&#160;the West Bank, Gaza Strip or&#160;<br/>neighbouring countries – an experience that Palestinians refer to as the&#160;<i>nakba</i>&#160;(catastrophe). The land and&#160;<br/>properties of the Palestinian refugees and those internally displaced&#160;in Israel by the war were confiscated269 &#160;<br/>and, as mentioned above, some 500 villages were destroyed. Israel replaced names of Palestinian villages&#160;<br/>with Hebrew ones.270 &#160;<br/>
While Israel only considers those who were forced to leave or fled in&#160;1948, but not their descendants,271&#160;<br/>as refugees, it denies these Palestinians their right of return as well as the return of their descendants. &#160;<br/>Palestinian refugees who fled to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, neighbouring Arab countries or other states&#160;<br/>were prohibited, and are still prohibited, from returning to their homes or lands in Israel. About 350,000&#160;<br/>people, mostly Palestinians, were displaced as a result of the Six-Day war between Israel and Egypt, Syria&#160;<br/>and Jordan in June 1967.272&#160;Israel also prohibits these Palestinians from returning to their homes.273&#160; &#160;<br/>
Palestinians who were displaced from land that became Israel in the&#160;1947-49 conflict and shortly after&#160;<br/>and from the OPT in 1967, as well as their descendants, are considered Palestinian refugees.274&#160;There&#160;<br/>are currently 5.6 million such refugees registered with UNRWA.275&#160;Some 2.2 million of them are refugees&#160;<br/>residing in the OPT, while the remaining 3.4 million continue to be displaced mainly in Jordan, Syria and&#160;<br/>Lebanon, where many face dire conditions in overcrowded camps, denial of access to essential services and&#160;<br/>human rights violations by the host governments.276<br/>
<b>5.3 SEGREGATION AND CONTROL<br/></b>Parallel to imposing measures that fragment Palestinians into distinct territorial, legal and administrative&#160;<br/>domains, Israel has pursued a strategy of establishing domination through discriminatory laws and policies&#160;<br/>that segregate Palestinians into enclaves based on their legal status and residence. In order to maintain&#160;<br/>Jewish Israeli domination in Israel and the OPT, Israel also continues to deny millions of Palestinian refugees&#160;<br/>displaced in the 1947-49 conflict or shortly after from land in the territory that became recognized as the&#160;<br/>State of Israel and subsequently Palestinian refugees displaced in 1967 from the OPT, as well as their&#160;<br/>descendants, the right to citizenship and residence by denying them their right of return to their homes in&#160;<br/>Israel and/or the OPT.&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
81<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a>This section covers Israel’s denial of Palestinians’ rights to equal nationality and status, and to freedom&#160;<br/>of movement; its restrictions on their right to family unification and,&#160;for Palestinian citizens of Israel and&#160;<br/>residents of East Jerusalem, to extend citizenship or residency to spouses from the OPT; and its undue&#160;<br/>limitations on their civil and political rights as a means of suppressing dissent.&#160;<br/>
<b>5.3.1 DENIAL OF RIGHT TO EQUAL NATIONALITY AND STATUS<br/></b>As mentioned above, Israel exercises authority over all Palestinians in all territories under its effective control&#160;<br/>and over the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in Israel and the OPT. While Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizens of Israel are allowed to vote in Israeli national elections, they are denied a nationality, establishing&#160;<br/>a legal differentiation from Jewish Israelis, and are discriminated against in their access to civic space.&#160;<br/>This is linked, in part, to their exemption from military service. Limitations on the civil and political rights of&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel further limit the extent to which they can participate in the political and social life&#160;<br/>of Israel.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians in the OPT, on the other hand, remain without citizenship and are considered stateless, except&#160;<br/>for those who have obtained a citizenship from a third country. At the same time, Israel has controlled the&#160;<br/>population registry in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 and imposed policies, restrictions and measures&#160;<br/>to control the demography of the territories.<br/>
<b>UNEQUAL AND SEPARATE CITIZENSHIP STRUCTURE IN ISRAEL &#160;<br/></b>While Palestinian citizens of Israel have Israeli citizenship, this has not been translated into their full&#160;<br/>societal integration into Israel. This is partly because Israeli law defines Jewish Israelis as national&#160;<br/>citizens, whereas Palestinian citizens of Israel are considered citizens but not nationals of Israel and as&#160;<br/>such they enjoy different and inferior rights and privileges in law and practice (see also section 5.3.5&#160;<br/>“Restrictions on right to political participation and popular resistance”).277<br/>
The requirements to become an Israeli citizen are set out in the Nationality Law of 1952, which covers&#160;<br/>Jewish people and non-Jewish people.278&#160;Article 2(a) of the law grants automatic citizenship rights to&#160;<br/>every Jewish immigrant under the Law of Return of 1950. As outlined above (see section 5.1 “Intent&#160;<br/>to oppress and dominate the Palestinian people), the Law of Return is effectively a nationality law that&#160;<br/>grants every Jew, regardless of where they reside in the world, the distinct right to settle in Israel with&#160;<br/>full legal and political rights.279&#160;An amendment to the law, which was added in 1970, defined a Jew&#160;<br/>as a “person who was born of a Jewish mother or has become converted to Judaism and who is not a&#160;<br/>member of another religion.”280&#160;<br/>
By contrast, Palestinian citizens of Israel are granted citizenship rights based on residence in Israel.&#160;<br/>Article 3(a) of the Nationality Law stipulates:<br/>
<i>A person who, immediately before the establishment of the State, was a Palestinian citizen and&#160;<br/>who does not become an Israel national under Article 2, shall become an Israel national with&#160;<br/>effect from the day of the establishment of the State.</i><br/>
Article 3(a) granted citizenship rights only to those who were registered as residents in the Registration&#160;<br/>of Inhabitants Ordinance of 1949, or were residents in the territory that became the State of Israel,&#160;<br/>or entered Israel legally from the day of its establishment in May 1948 until the Nationality Law was&#160;<br/>enacted in April 1952. While the law granted Palestinians who remained in Israel an Israeli citizenship&#160;<br/>status, it stripped Palestinian refugees who fled during the&#160;1947-49 conflict and shortly after of their&#160;<br/>
277.&#160;At the same time Palestinians have been and continue to be subjected to an oppressive&#160;regime of property confiscation and&#160;<br/>
discrimination in access to resources (including housing) that has resulted in their segregation from Jewish Israeli society.&#160;<br/>

<a name=83></a>Palestinian citizenship granted under the Palestinian Citizenship Orders of 1925-1942.281&#160;Israel’s&#160;<br/>policy since 2002, which was enshrined in law in the form of the Citizenship and Entry into Israel&#160;<br/>Law, a temporary order that lasted from 2003 to 2021, denies citizens and residents of Israel who&#160;<br/>marry Palestinians from the OPT from passing on their legal status in Israel, including residency and&#160;<br/>citizenship (see section 5.3.3 “Separation of families through discriminatory laws”).282<br/>
This unequal and separate citizenship structure has resulted in stark discrimination against Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizens in several ways and their segmentation from other Palestinians in the OPT (through imposing&#160;<br/>constraints on family life), and has hindered their political and voting rights. The Israeli Ministry of&#160;<br/>Foreign Affairs claims that “Arab Israelis are citizens of… Israel with equal rights” and the “only legal&#160;<br/>distinction between Arab and Jewish citizens is… civic duty”,&#160;because Palestinian citizens are exempt&#160;<br/>from military service.283&#160;Military service is mandatory in Israel for Jewish Israeli men and women, as&#160;<br/>well as Druze and Circassian men. Whilst Palestinians largely refuse to join the Israeli army for national&#160;<br/>and political reasons, the exemption of Palestinian citizens of Israel from military service has resulted in&#160;<br/>their discriminatory exclusion from substantial economic benefits and opportunities guaranteed under&#160;<br/>Israeli law to those who have completed military service.<br/>
<b>EXEMPTION OF PALESTINIANS FROM MILITARY SERVICE, EXCLUSION FROM ECONOMIC BENEFITS</b><br/>
Military service is mandatory in Israel for Jewish Israeli men and women, as well as Druze and Circassian&#160;<br/>men in Israel.284&#160;Palestinian citizens of Israel are exempt and, since the establishment of the State of&#160;<br/>Israel in 1948, have largely not served in its army for national and political reasons.285&#160;The exemption is&#160;<br/>not based on law but was established as an administrative practice based on the discretionary powers of&#160;<br/>Israel’s army under the provisions of the Defense Service Law of 1986.286<br/>
To Israeli citizens who complete military service, the state affords substantial economic compensation&#160;<br/>and&#160;access&#160;to&#160;employment&#160;in&#160;certain&#160;fields&#160;such&#160;as&#160;the&#160;military&#160;and&#160;security&#160;industries,&#160;as&#160;well&#160;as&#160;access&#160;<br/>to housing subsidies. The Absorption of Discharged Soldiers Law of 1994 and its later amendments&#160;<br/>enumerate a broad range of benefits exclusively available to former soldiers, including educational&#160;<br/>grants and housing.287<br/>
By linking benefits to military service, the state ensures that the overwhelming majority of Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizens of Israel are excluded from them. While the minority of Jewish Israelis who do not serve in&#160;<br/>the army are also denied these benefits, they are at least presented with a meaningful choice. It&#160;<br/>is inconceivable for almost any Palestinian citizen of Israel to serve in any army that is occupying&#160;<br/>Palestinian&#160;land&#160;and&#160;systematically&#160;repressing&#160;Palestinians’&#160;rights.&#160;The&#160;link&#160;between&#160;benefits&#160;and&#160;military&#160;<br/>service has been the subject of public debate in Israel for decades, focused on the idea of creating a&#160;<br/>

<b>FRAGILE PERMANENT RESIDENCY STATUS OF EAST JERUSALEM PALESTINIANS &#160;<br/></b>Under Israeli law, Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and are not residents&#160;<br/>of the West Bank. Instead, they are granted fragile permanent residency status that allows them to&#160;<br/>reside and work in the city, enjoy social benefits provided by the Israeli National Insurance Institute&#160;<br/>and the national health insurance, and vote in municipal elections but not in national elections.291&#160; &#160;<br/>This status may be revoked on a number of discriminatory grounds affecting a wide range of social&#160;<br/>and economic rights. While permanent residents can acquire Israeli citizenship if they desire, they&#160;<br/>must swear allegiance to Israel, prove they are not citizens of any other country, and demonstrate&#160;<br/>some knowledge of Hebrew. Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of residents&#160;<br/>requesting Israeli citizenship, but they face a long wait before the Israeli Population and Migration&#160;<br/>Authority processes their applications.292&#160;<br/>
Following its annexation of East Jerusalem in 1967, Israel applied its “law, jurisdiction and&#160;<br/>administration”, but it did not grant Palestinians living in the annexed area Israeli citizenship under&#160;<br/>the Nationality Law of 1952. Instead, it conferred permanent residency status on residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem under the Entry into Israel Law of 1952, and maintained that such residents could only&#160;<br/>acquire Israeli citizenship through naturalization.293&#160;People with this status can live and work in&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and Israel provided they maintain a presence in the city or Israel. The Entry into Israel Law&#160;<br/>grants Israel’s minister of interior discretion to “cancel any permit of residence” granted under the law.294&#160;<br/>
The permanent residency status is not permanent in reality. Israel has enacted legislation and several&#160;<br/>policies and measures that have resulted in Palestinians with this status losing their right and ability to&#160;<br/>live in the city. By contrast, Jewish Israeli settlers residing in East Jerusalem enjoy Israeli citizenship&#160;<br/>and are exempt from laws and measures enacted against Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem. In&#160;<br/>this way, Israel has consolidated its sovereignty over the city and restricted the number of Palestinians&#160;<br/>

<a name=85></a>living in East Jerusalem to maintain a Jewish majority in the city – a key policy objective in Jerusalem&#160;<br/>since the outset of the occupation.295<br/>
&#160;The Israeli Ministry of Interior has used its discretion to revoke the residency status of thousands of&#160;<br/>Palestinian residents of Jerusalem through various policies and measures, affecting a total of 14,701&#160;<br/>Palestinians between 1967 and 2020.296&#160;<br/>
In 1996, the Ministry of Interior began implementing a measure known as the “centre of life” policy&#160;<br/>that has led to the revocation of the residency status of thousands of Palestinian residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem over the years.297&#160;Under the policy, which many local human rights organizations have&#160;<br/>labelled a “quiet deportation”, the minister of interior can revoke the permanent residency status of&#160;<br/>Palestinians if they are unable to prove that Jerusalem is their “centre of life”.<br/>
Under Regulation 11A of the Entry into Israel Regulations of 1974, a person is considered to have&#160;<br/>settled “outside Israel” if they have lived outside Israel for at least seven years, received a permanent&#160;<br/>residency status in a foreign country, or become a citizen of another country.298&#160;These and other&#160;<br/>conditions are taken as proof that a resident’s “centre of life” is no longer in Israel. In some cases, the&#160;<br/>procurement of residency or citizenship in another country, even if the permanent resident has lived&#160;<br/>outside Jerusalem for less than seven years, has been a basis for revocation.<br/>
The Ministry of Interior places the burden of proof on Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem to prove&#160;<br/>that Jerusalem is their “centre of life”; they must provide a set of documents to the Ministry, such as&#160;<br/>confirmation of payment of taxes and national insurance bills, rental or home ownership contracts,&#160;<br/>electricity and water bills, and proof that their children are in schools in Jerusalem.299<br/>
Permanent residency status does not guarantee that the holder’s children or non-resident spouse&#160;<br/>will be granted the same status. Since 2002, children whose parents are Palestinian residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem but are born in the OPT outside of East Jerusalem can no longer be automatically registered&#160;<br/>on their parents’ identification cards as Jerusalem residents; their parents must submit an application&#160;<br/>for their children.300&#160;Under Israel’s policy since 2002, which was enshrined in law in the form of the&#160;<br/>Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, a temporary order that lasted from 2003 to July 2021, Palestinian&#160;<br/>residents of Jerusalem who marry Palestinians from the rest of the OPT cannot secure residency status&#160;<br/>for their spouse to live with them in Jerusalem. This has forced many couples to leave Jerusalem&#160;<br/>and lose their residency status under the “centre of life” policy.301&#160;The Israeli Ministry of Interior has&#160;<br/>also placed onerous conditions on the registration of children of these “mixed couples”, requiring the&#160;<br/>parents to apply to register children under the age of 12 with proof that Jerusalem was their “centre of&#160;<br/>life” (see section 5.3.3 “Separation of families through discriminatory laws”).302<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=86></a>Israeli authorities can also cancel the residency status of East Jerusalem Palestinians for “breach&#160;<br/>of allegiance” based on a 2018 amendment to the Entry into Israel Law that grants the minister of&#160;<br/>interior broad discretionary powers to revoke a permanent residency status “if it has been proven to the&#160;<br/>Minister’s satisfaction that the status holder performed a deed which involves breach of allegiance to&#160;<br/>the State of Israel.”303&#160;The amendment defined such a breach to include committing an&#160;act of terror as&#160;<br/>defined in the Counter-Terrorism Law of 2016, or an act of treason or aggravated espionage under the&#160;<br/>Penal Code of 1977.304&#160;The Israeli human rights organization HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the&#160;<br/>Individual (HaMoked) has warned that the law has no clear criteria for its application, which in effect&#160;<br/>may enable the arbitrary revocation of the permanent residency status of Palestinians on the grounds&#160;<br/>of “breach of allegiance”.305<br/>
&#160;The amendment was originally proposed by then interior minister Roni Bar-On in 2006 in order to&#160;<br/>revoke the residency status of four people elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). In&#160;<br/>January 2006, the four – all Palestinian residents of Jerusalem – were elected after running for the&#160;<br/>Change and Reform party, a list affiliated with Hamas that took&#160;part in the PLC and municipal elections&#160;<br/>in various West Bank cities. Five months later, Roni Bar-On ordered the revocation of their residency&#160;<br/>status. Israeli authorities then forcibly transferred the four Palestinians to the West Bank and have not&#160;<br/>allowed them to enter Jerusalem since then.&#160;<br/>
The amendment was eventually enacted into law in September 2017. This followed a verdict by the&#160;<br/>Supreme Court of Israel on a petition against the revocation of the residency permits of the four elected&#160;<br/>PLC members. The Supreme Court ruled that there was no law that granted the Israeli Interior Ministry&#160;<br/>authority to revoke residency status for “breach of allegiance”, and that the minister’s decision was&#160;<br/>therefore illegal.306&#160;However, the Supreme Court suspended its decision for six months to allow the&#160;<br/>minister to seek the Knesset’s support in adopting a new law that would authorize the minister to&#160;<br/>revoke the residency status of Palestinian Jerusalemites based on “breach of allegiance”.307<br/>
The Ministry of Interior revealed that it had revoked the residency status of 13 Palestinians for “breach&#160;<br/>of allegiance” between 2007 and 2017 (it would not reveal the total number of such revocations).308&#160;<br/>The ministry also applied the legislation retroactively against at least two Palestinians for alleged&#160;<br/>participation in attacks against Israelis.309&#160;In September 2019, HaMoked petitioned the Supreme Court&#160;<br/>of Israel to repeal the law and to reinstate the permanent residency status of those affected.310&#160;The&#160;<br/>petition was ongoing as of July 2021.<br/>
The revocation of the permanent residency of Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem means they&#160;<br/>must leave the city, resulting in them losing associated social benefits and access to national health&#160;<br/>insurance. In some cases, other family members, such as children or spouses whose residency rights&#160;<br/>

<b>CONTROL OF DEMOGRAPHICS IN REST OF WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP THROUGH POPULATION REGISTRY &#160;<br/></b>Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip remain without a citizenship and are&#160;<br/>considered stateless, except for those who obtained a citizenship from a third country. The Israeli&#160;<br/>military issues them with identification cards that enable them&#160;to permanently live and work in the&#160;<br/>territory.<br/>
After Israel’s victory in the 1967 war, it took control of the population registry in the West Bank and&#160;<br/>imposed policies, restrictions and measures to control the demography of the territory. It immediately&#160;<br/>declared the West Bank and Gaza Strip a “closed military area” and required Palestinian residents to&#160;<br/>obtain permits for entry and exit.313&#160;Within three months, Israel had conducted a census of Palestinians&#160;<br/>in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, and only registered the 954,898 Palestinians who were&#160;<br/>physically present. At least 270,000 Palestinians, who were absent at the time for various reasons,&#160;<br/>such as work or residence in another country, or had been forcibly displaced or had left as a result of&#160;<br/>the war, were denied the right to return to their homes or to live in the OPT.314&#160;<br/>
The Israeli military issued those who were present with identification cards as a condition for&#160;<br/>permanent residency in the OPT. Those who wanted to leave were required to obtain special “exit&#160;<br/>permits” and leave their identification card behind with the Israeli military. Palestinians who exceeded&#160;<br/>the period of their exit permits or people who resided outside the OPT for more than seven consecutive&#160;<br/>years were deleted from the population registry.315&#160;The Israeli military cancelled the residency status of&#160;<br/>about 140,000 West Bank Palestinians as a result of this procedure between 1967 and 1994,316&#160;and&#160;<br/>imposed further restrictions on the registration of foreign spouses of Palestinians and their children&#160;<br/>during this period.317&#160;Some 108,000 Palestinians from Gaza also lost their residency status during the&#160;<br/>same period because they had resided abroad for more than seven years and were considered to have&#160;<br/>transferred their “centre of life”, or because they had failed to participate in the population censuses&#160;<br/>in 1981 and 1988.318&#160;After the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1995, Israel re-registered 10,000 of the&#160;<br/>West Bank Palestinians and stopped using this procedure to revoke the residency status of Palestinians&#160;<br/>in the OPT.319&#160;<br/>
In 1981, the Israeli Civil Administration was established and became the body responsible for&#160;<br/>administering the population registry, including the registration of births, deaths, changes of address,&#160;<br/>

<a name=88></a>marriages and divorces in the OPT. In 1995, under the Oslo Accords, the newly established Palestinian&#160;<br/>Authority was to take over the administration of the population registry, including the conferring of&#160;<br/>residency status and the registration of spouses and children of Palestinian residents who were born&#160;<br/>in the West Bank and Gaza Strip or abroad. The Palestinian Authority was required to regularly share&#160;<br/>information on the population registry with Israel, while Israel would maintain a copy.320&#160;However, in&#160;<br/>practice, the Israeli military continued its effective control of the West Bank, including the control of&#160;<br/>the population registry and residence in the OPT. The Palestinian Authority took on the administrative&#160;<br/>responsibility of accepting requests relating to the population registry and processing relevant fees&#160;<br/>before transferring the applications to the Israeli Civil Administration for approval.321&#160;Only following&#160;<br/>Israel’s approval can the Palestinian authorities issue residents with an identification card, which&#160;<br/>became known as the Palestinian identification card.<br/>
After the outbreak of the Palestinian&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;at the end of 2000, the Israeli Civil Administration froze&#160;<br/>most changes to the population registry without notifying the Palestinian Authority in advance. The only&#160;<br/>changes Israeli authorities continue to regularly process are requests for the registration of children&#160;<br/>aged under 16 if at least one of their parents holds a Palestinian identification card and they are&#160;<br/>physically present in the West Bank. These measures remain in effect.322&#160;<br/>
The freeze included the suspension of all “family unification”&#160;procedures for Palestinian residents of&#160;<br/>the OPT who had married foreign nationals. Israel continues to deny the conferring of residency status&#160;<br/>to tens of thousands of foreign nationals who are married to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip.323&#160;This is profoundly discriminatory; Jewish settlers residing in settlements in the West Bank&#160;<br/>face no restrictions in obtaining authorization from the Israeli authorities for their spouses to enter the&#160;<br/>occupied territory and reside with them.<br/>
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank have continued to&#160;<br/>submit applications for new entries to be included in the population registry and follow up on the&#160;<br/>matter.324&#160;According to media reports, thousands of individuals have applied for residency status in the&#160;<br/>West Bank and have been left in limbo.325&#160;Some affected families have recently held weekly protests&#160;<br/>in front of the Palestinian Ministry of Civil Affairs and sometimes in front of the headquarters of the&#160;<br/>Israeli Civil Administration to demand they be granted the residency status needed to live together in&#160;<br/>the occupied West Bank.326&#160;The protests have been joined by Palestinians who are originally from Gaza&#160;<br/>and have been unable to change their residency status to the West Bank even though many have lived&#160;<br/>there for years.327<br/>

<a name=89></a><b>FAMILY LIVES DISRUPTED&#160;</b><br/>
<b>Alia Khalil</b><br/>
Alia Khalil is a Jordanian citizen who has been living without documentation in the West Bank town&#160;<br/>of Huwara, south of the city of Nablus, because for 27 years Israel has refused to include her in the&#160;<br/>population registry and thereby allow her to live legally with her family. This has devastated her life as&#160;<br/>she is unable to commute freely between cities or travel abroad for fear of being caught by the Israeli&#160;<br/>army and deported.&#160;<br/>
Alia Khalil’s family is originally from Salfit, south of Nablus, but have&#160;lived in Jordan since 1991.328&#160;She&#160;<br/>married a Palestinian from the West Bank in 1994 and moved to the West Bank from Jordan straight&#160;<br/>away. She immediately started the family reunification process that would&#160;include her in the population&#160;<br/>registry and allow her residency in the West Bank. She has received a permit from the Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>to leave the West Bank only twice, first following the death of her father in&#160;Jordan in 2006, and again for&#160;<br/>a family visit in 2007. In 2010, she received a tourist visa that would allow her to stay with her family.&#160;<br/>This expired after a few months. She told Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>I have been waiting to get my ID [residency status] for the past 27 years. I have been here since&#160;<br/>1994, been stuck here really… My husband and children have been able to go see my family in&#160;<br/>Jordan [as they have Palestinian identification papers and passports], while I haven’t. I’ll be honest&#160;<br/>with you, it breaks my heart every time I see my husband leave with the kids to Jordan. Their [the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities’] continuous decision to refuse to approve our family&#160;unification applications&#160;<br/>keeps on hindering our stability further. Normally people get married so they can settle down, build&#160;<br/>a new life together, and have some kind of stability in their lives. I haven’t tasted that feeling of&#160;<br/>stability once, not once since 1994. Imagine living a lifetime of uneasiness and terror. I am upset, I&#160;<br/>am mad, and I am distressed, and I want my right to exist in peace.&#160;Is this too much to ask?329&#160;</i><br/>
Alia Khalil described how Israel’s denial of residency status has prevented her from registering for&#160;<br/>college or university, opening a bank account, accessing health insurance, being added to her&#160;<br/>husband’s health insurance plan, or obtaining a driver’s licence:<br/>
<i>My husband was able to add his parents to his health insurance plan while I was left out. I&#160;<br/>consider myself lucky as I have not had to deal with any serious illness. But for the past 27 years&#160;<br/>every time I needed a doctor it was all at our own expense, which is rather costly.330&#160;</i><br/>
<b>D. Z.&#160;</b><br/>
D. Z., a Jordanian citizen who married a Palestinian resident from the West Bank in 1997, lives on&#160;<br/>the outskirts of the city of Ramallah. She has been waiting to have her&#160;family reunification application&#160;<br/>approved for the past 23 years. As soon as she married in 1997, her husband applied for family&#160;<br/>unification. She first entered the West Bank on a “visit permit” that she had to renew every seven&#160;<br/>months. In order to renew it, she had to leave the West Bank, travelling to Jordan and then entering the&#160;<br/>West Bank again from there. She continued to do this until 2000, when the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;erupted and&#160;<br/>the Israeli authorities stopped providing entry permits. She told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>That year it was the intifada, the second one, when I left [the West Bank to Jordan] as normal to&#160;<br/>re-enter and obtain a permit from the Israeli authorities, but they didn’t let me in because they&#160;<br/>froze entry permits for everyone during that time. That’s when I got stuck in Jordan for 12 years&#160;<br/>without being able to go back to Palestine.</i><br/>
328.&#160;Though originally from Salfit, West Bank, Alia Khalil was born in Kuwait. Her parents migrated&#160;to Jordan after her birth and have been&#160;<br/>
there ever since. Her parents died, but the rest of her family members remain in Jordan.<br/>

D. Z.’s husband continued to visit her regularly in Jordan, but he could not move there because of his&#160;<br/>job. Their two children stayed with her in Jordan. During that period they had two more children. The&#160;<br/>children were unable to obtain her Jordanian nationality due to the “foreign nationality” of her husband,&#160;<br/>in accordance with Jordanian law. This meant that the couple had to bear the financial burden of&#160;<br/>education fees and medical services at private schools and clinics.&#160;<br/>
In 2012, the Israeli authorities provided what were referred to as “Ramadan permits” and D. Z. obtained&#160;<br/>one. She entered the West Bank and has been there ever since, overstaying her entry permit. This&#160;<br/>has left her in constant fear of being caught by the Israeli authorities during random checks or at&#160;<br/>checkpoints between different cities and villages. If she were stopped, she could be detained and then&#160;<br/>deported to Jordan as she is not a legal resident of the West Bank.&#160;<br/>
This fear and instability have affected every part of her life, including her access to healthcare, her ability&#160;<br/>to work legally and her freedom of movement. Her exhausting situation reached a new level when she&#160;<br/>realized she could not be with one of her daughters at a critical moment:&#160;<br/>
<i>The past 20 years have been one form of torture and these coming ones are another. The straw&#160;<br/>that broke the camel’s back was my 20-year-old daughter getting sick. On December 2020, her&#160;<br/>kidneys failed and she started undergoing kidney dialysis. She has dialysis three times a week in&#160;<br/>a hospital in Ramallah and I have to accompany her. These weekly trips are extremely difficult&#160;<br/>as they are; we also undergo the terror of being caught by random Israeli checkpoints that would&#160;<br/>probably lead to my deportation, that is with us being merely 20 minutes away by car. Her doctors&#160;<br/>determined that she needs a transplant – she needs to undergo this procedure in Jordan where&#160;<br/>she will require a six-month recovery period. Six months of me, her mother, not being able to be&#160;<br/>with her to support her during this extremely difficult period.331</i><br/>

<hr/>
<a name=91></a>In 2008, as a one-time diplomatic gesture towards the Palestinian authorities, Israel committed to&#160;<br/>granting 50,000 family reunification requests. According to reports, Israel granted requests only to&#160;<br/>those physically present in the OPT at the time,332&#160;whereby around 35,000 requests were approved.333&#160;&#160;<br/>However, there is no information publicly available on how many of the 35,000 were actually granted&#160;<br/>permanent residency status.334<br/>
In addition to the restrictions Israel imposed on the Palestinian population registry in the OPT following&#160;<br/>the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>, in early 2003 Israel began prohibiting Palestinians registered in Gaza from residing&#160;<br/>in the West Bank. This policy is based on Military Order 34 of 1967, which declared the West Bank a&#160;<br/>“closed military area”.335&#160;Under this policy, Israel has arrested thousands of Palestinians and forcibly&#160;<br/>removed them from the West Bank to Gaza, even if they had been living in the West Bank for years and&#160;<br/>had families and work there.336&#160;&#160;<br/>
In 2009, an estimated 25,000 Palestinians with registered addresses in Gaza were living in the West&#160;<br/>Bank. Israel refused to recognize their right to live there,&#160;labelling them as “infiltrators”. Many of&#160;<br/>them are effectively locked in their local areas as they could not travel freely within the West Bank or&#160;<br/>abroad.337&#160;In 2011, Israel announced that it would allow 5,000 Palestinians to change their address&#160;<br/>from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank, which it implemented partially over subsequent years.338&#160;In&#160;<br/>October 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Defense authorized changes to the population registry for 4,000&#160;<br/>people as another “gesture” to the Palestinian authorities, in a move, which fell far short of the&#160;<br/>expectations of activists campaigning for family unification.&#160;Only 1,200 of these 4,000 people were&#160;<br/>actually granted residency status. The remaining 2,800 were merely allowed to change their registered&#160;<br/>addresses from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank.339&#160;<br/>
<b>IBTIHAL JABER&#160;</b><br/>
Ibtihal Jaber, from the Gaza Strip, married O. K., from Hebron, in March 2020 in Egypt because they&#160;<br/>could not meet or marry in the OPT. Their plan was to obtain their documents together and apply for&#160;<br/>a permit to settle in the West Bank. After the pandemic hit and travel restrictions were imposed, their&#160;<br/>plans became near impossible. When their visas in Egypt were about to expire, O. K., who was not&#160;<br/>allowed to enter Gaza, returned to the West Bank. Ibtihal Jaber, pregnant and not allowed to enter the&#160;<br/>West Bank, returned to Gaza. She told Amnesty International at the&#160;time: “I am terrified of giving birth in&#160;<br/>Gaza, having a baby, and being stuck in Gaza all alone without my husband. And God knows when I’ll&#160;<br/>be able to reunite with him. It is terrifying.”340&#160;&#160;<br/>

<a name=92></a>She delivered a baby boy, Muhammed, on 1 January 2021. By this time, she had also lost touch with&#160;<br/>her husband: “New Year is supposed to be a symbol for a new beginning and new chapters in life. Mine&#160;<br/>started with a new baby without his father by his side. What kind of new chapter is this?”341<br/>
Due to her special circumstances, the Palestinian authorities in Gaza registered her as married despite&#160;<br/>her husband not being with her. This allowed her to obtain documentation for her child, but she remains&#160;<br/>uncertain about how she can obtain a divorce or child support from her husband after they agreed to&#160;<br/>separate because they could not live together.<br/>
<i>My father has taken on all of the financial responsibilities regarding my son. He wanted me to have&#160;<br/>a stable life. Now he has to carry not only my burden but also that of my son. And I want to make&#160;<br/>my husband pay his dues by the rule of the law, but how can we do it? Which courts should I resort&#160;<br/>to? Courts in Gaza? They will be useless as they have no jurisdiction&#160;in the West Bank, and I have&#160;<br/>no one in the West Bank to follow my case, or even present it. I am lost; I have no idea what to do.</i><br/>
In addition, there are approximately 5,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip who remain undocumented&#160;<br/>because the Israeli authorities have continuously refused to regularize their status since 2008.342&#160;While&#160;<br/>the de facto authorities in Gaza have taken steps to improve their daily lives by issuing them with&#160;<br/>temporary identity cards, which are accepted by most employers, healthcare providers and UNRWA,&#160;<br/>they are not recognized by the Ramallah-based Palestinian authorities. As a result, these Palestinians&#160;<br/>in Gaza still experience difficulties opening a bank account or&#160;making any bank transactions given&#160;<br/>that banking mechanisms continue to be linked to the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and,&#160;<br/>ultimately, to Israel.343&#160;Due to the lack of a legal status, they experience even greater travel restrictions&#160;<br/>than the rest of Gaza’s population, and are automatically denied employment and educational&#160;<br/>opportunities in the rest of the OPT and abroad in the rare cases they arise. Most importantly, these&#160;<br/>added complications mean that those without residence or identity cards cannot access potentially life-<br/>saving medical treatment outside of the Gaza Strip, even in cases of emergency.344&#160;<br/>
Israel’s control of the population registry has thus further facilitated the fragmentation of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>people and restrictions on their freedom of movement based on their legal status and residence, or&#160;<br/>lack thereof. It has serious consequences on the ability of Palestinians in the OPT to lead a normal life:&#160;<br/>those in the West Bank who are not registered face the imminent threat of deportation, are unable to&#160;<br/>access healthcare, education and social benefits, open a bank account and have legal jobs, and are&#160;<br/>effectively prisoners in their homes because they fear ID checks and arrests at Israeli checkpoints (see&#160;<br/>section 5.3.2 “Restrictions on Palestinians’ freedom of movement”).345&#160;Undocumented Palestinians&#160;<br/>in Gaza are also denied their freedom of movement, and access to healthcare and education in&#160;<br/>other parts of the OPT and abroad. Overall, restrictions on family unification in effect interfere with&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ enjoyment of their rights to privacy, to family life and to marry, blocking them from&#160;<br/>conferring residency status to their spouses and children.&#160;<br/>

<a name=93></a><b>CITIZENSHIP AND RIGHT TO RETURN DENIED &#160;<br/></b>As stated above, Israel continues to deny Palestinian refugees – displaced in the 1947-49 and 1967&#160;<br/>conflicts – and their descendants their right to gain Israeli&#160;citizenship or residency status in Israel or the&#160;<br/>OPT. By doing so, it denies them their right to return to their former places of residence and property&#160;<br/>– a right, which has been widely recognized under international human rights law.346&#160;The right to&#160;<br/>return to one’s own country is guaranteed under international human rights law.347&#160;The right to return&#160;<br/>applies not just to those who were directly expelled and their immediate families, but also to those of&#160;<br/>their descendants who have maintained “close and enduring connections” with the area.348&#160;Lasting&#160;<br/>connections between individuals and territory may exist independently of the formal determination&#160;<br/>of nationality held by the individuals.349&#160;Israel’s failure to respect the right of return for Palestinians&#160;<br/>refugees is thus a flagrant violation of international law that&#160;has fuelled decades of suffering on a mass&#160;<br/>scale for Palestinian refugees across the region.350<br/>

<i>Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from&#160;<br/>participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate&#160;<br/>creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in particular by&#160;<br/>denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and freedoms… the right to&#160;<br/>leave and to return to their country…351</i><br/>
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides in Article 13: “Everyone has the right to leave any&#160;<br/>country, including his own, and to return to his country.” Article 12(4) of the International Covenant on&#160;<br/>Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) codifies the right of return: “No one&#160;shall be arbitrarily deprived of the&#160;<br/>right to enter his own country.”&#160;<br/>
The UN Human Rights Committee has asserted that the right to return to one’s “own country” also&#160;<br/>applies in relation to disputed territories or territories that have changed hands:&#160;<br/>
<i>The scope of “his own country” is broader than the concept “country of his nationality”. It is&#160;<br/>not limited to nationality in a formal sense, that is, nationality acquired at birth or by conferral;&#160;<br/>it embraces, at the very least, an individual who, because of his or her special ties to or claims&#160;<br/>in relation to a given country, cannot be considered to be a mere alien. This would be the case,&#160;<br/>for example, of nationals of a country who have been stripped of their nationality in violation of&#160;<br/>international law, and of individuals whose country of nationality has been incorporated in or&#160;<br/>transferred to another national entity, whose nationality is being denied them.352&#160;</i><br/>

The right to return applies not just to those who were directly expelled and their immediate families, but&#160;<br/>also to those of their descendants who have maintained “close and enduring connections” with the area.353&#160;<br/>Lasting connections between individuals and territory may exist independently of the formal determination&#160;<br/>of nationality (or lack thereof) held by the individuals, as explained by the Human Rights Committee:&#160;<br/>
<i>The right of a person to enter his or her own country recognizes the special relationship of a&#160;<br/>person to that country... It includes not only the right to return after having left one’s own country;&#160;<br/>it may also entitle a person to come to the country for the first time if&#160;he or she was born outside&#160;<br/>the country (for example, if that country is the person’s State of nationality).354</i><br/>
The International Court of Justice delineated a standard for measuring the existence of a “close and&#160;<br/>enduring connection” between a person and their “own country”. In the landmark Nottebohm case of&#160;<br/>1955, which focused on the determination of nationality, the court held that “genuine” and “effective”&#160;<br/>links between an individual and a state were based on “... a social fact of attachment, a genuine&#160;<br/>connection of existence, interests and sentiments...” The court also noted:&#160;<br/>
<i>Different factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to&#160;<br/>the next: there is the habitual residence of the individual concerned but also the centre of his&#160;<br/>interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given&#160;<br/>country and inculcated in his children, etc.355&#160;</i><br/>
Other criteria suggested by the court include cultural traditions, way of life, activities and intentions for&#160;<br/>the near future. The criteria established by the International Court of Justice are likewise appropriate&#160;<br/>when determining a person’s “own country” in that they are regarded as a standard measure of the&#160;<br/>effective existence of ties between the individual and the state in question.356<br/>

<a name=95></a><b>5.3.2 RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AS A MEANS OF&#160;<br/>CONTROL OVER LAND AND PEOPLE<br/></b>Since the mid-1990s the Israeli authorities have imposed a closure system within the OPT and between the&#160;<br/>OPT and Israel, gradually subjecting millions of Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to ever&#160;<br/>more stringent restrictions on movement. These restrictions are another tool through which Israel segregates&#160;<br/>Palestinians into separate enclaves, isolates them from each other and the rest of the world and, ultimately,&#160;<br/>enforces its domination regime.<br/>
Israel controls all entry and exit points in the West Bank and controls all travel between the West Bank and&#160;<br/>abroad. Israel also controls all movement of people into and out of the Gaza Strip to the rest of the OPT&#160;<br/>and Israel through the Erez crossing, the passenger crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. With the&#160;<br/>exception of East Jerusalemites, who have a permanent residency status in Israel, Palestinians from the&#160;<br/>OPT cannot travel abroad via Israeli airports, notably Ben Gurion airport, Israel’s main international airport&#160;<br/>located near Tel Aviv, unless they obtain a special permit, which is issued only to senior businesspeople and&#160;<br/>individuals with exceptional humanitarian needs.357&#160;An international airport was officially inaugurated in Gaza&#160;<br/>in 1998 as part of the Oslo Accords, but Israel halted flights there shortly after the start of the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;<br/>in 2000 and then bombed it in 2001. Since then it has in effect prevented its reconstruction, as well as the&#160;<br/>construction of a seaport.358&#160;This means that Palestinians in the OPT must rely on land crossings to travel&#160;<br/>abroad, and, with the exception of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which is regularly shut by the Egyptian&#160;<br/>authorities, are dependent on Israel to enter and exit the OPT.<br/>
Nearly all Palestinians living in the OPT face restrictions or difficulties travelling abroad. When they manage&#160;<br/>to do so, Palestinians must return to the OPT through the same crossing they used to exit the territories.359&#160;<br/>Palestinians from the West Bank, including those who hold foreign passports, can only travel abroad via&#160;<br/>the Allenby / King Hussein crossing with Jordan, which is controlled by Israel. However, Israeli military and&#160;<br/>security forces can ban West Bank Palestinians from doing so, often on the basis of “secret information”&#160;<br/>that Palestinians cannot review and therefore challenge.360&#160;In most cases, they find out about such bans&#160;<br/>only upon their arrival at the crossing when they attempt to leave the West Bank. These bans have affected&#160;<br/>human rights defenders and activists who travel abroad to advocate for Palestinians’ rights, among others.&#160;<br/>
For Palestinians in Gaza, travel abroad is nearly impossible under Israel’s illegal blockade, which Israel&#160;<br/>imposes on Gaza’s entire population as a form of collective punishment (see section 5.5.1 “Suppression of&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ human development”), citing general security concerns, in the absence of specific, concrete&#160;<br/>and time-bound evidence. Indeed, travel through the Erez crossing is limited to rare exceptions (see below).&#160;<br/>With tight Egyptian restrictions maintained on the Rafah crossing, Gazans must obtain official permits from&#160;<br/>the Israeli Civil Administration to exit Gaza. This has effectively segregated Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from&#160;<br/>the rest of the OPT, Israel and the rest of the world.<br/>
While Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are allowed to travel abroad&#160;<br/>via Israel’s ports, until recently the Israeli authorities banned approximately 4,000 Palestinian spouses from&#160;<br/>

<a name=96></a>the OPT with Israeli temporary residency status granted to them under&#160;the family reunification process from&#160;<br/>enjoying the same right. This policy was reversed through a decision issued by the Supreme Court in June&#160;<br/>2019 following a petition filed by HaMoked three years earlier. However, in November 2019, the court failed&#160;<br/>to grant the same rights to Palestinian spouses lawfully residing in Israel and the OPT with military “stay&#160;<br/>permits”, continuing to segregate over 9,000 families.361<br/>
Despite their ability to leave and enter Israel via the same crossings as Jewish citizens, Palestinian citizens&#160;<br/>of Israel and residents of East Jerusalem continue to report being subjected to separate discriminatory and&#160;<br/>humiliating security checks and interrogations at Israel’s airports based on their national identity, despite&#160;<br/>some improvements introduced as a result of a legal petition filed in&#160;2007 by ACRI.362&#160;The petition had&#160;<br/>sought to remove “national identity” as a criterion for assessing the level of security screening for passengers&#160;<br/>at Israeli airports;363&#160;argued that “Arab” passengers are forced to undergo humiliating treatment that is “not&#160;<br/>applied to Jewish passengers; and called for all passengers to be subjected to the same security criteria,&#160;<br/>regardless of nationality”. After an eight-year-long legal battle, in 2015, the Supreme Court eventually&#160;<br/>rejected the petition, arguing that the changes made to the screening process, which were aimed at&#160;<br/>“alleviating the sense of discrimination” and subjecting all passengers to an automated luggage checking&#160;<br/>system, had rendered a ruling on the petition inappropriate. By refusing to rule on the systematic distinction&#160;<br/>between Jewish and Palestinian citizens in the screening process, the court effectively condoned the&#160;<br/>discriminatory policy, stating:&#160;<br/>
<i>We must wait and see whether the significant changes that have been implemented will truly help&#160;<br/>and decrease the differentiation between Israeli citizens of different groups for the purpose of security&#160;<br/>checks in Israeli airports.364</i><br/>
Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees and their descendants continue to be denied their right to enter Israel and&#160;<br/>the OPT and to return to their homes and other property.<br/>
With regards to movement within the West Bank, between 1967 and 1991 Palestinians could move freely&#160;<br/>within the OPT and between the OPT and Israel. In early 1991, Israel started to require Palestinians from the&#160;<br/>West Bank and Gaza Strip to obtain individual permits from the Israeli Civil Administration to enter Jerusalem&#160;<br/>and Israel for any purpose, even to receive healthcare.365&#160;It was relatively easy for Palestinians to obtain&#160;<br/>permits until early 1993, when the Israeli army began gradually to erect military checkpoints and impose a&#160;<br/>closure system within the OPT and between the OPT and Israel.&#160;<br/>
Israel imposed a comprehensive closure system on the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank following&#160;<br/>the outbreak of the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;at the end of 2000, which remains in effect in various forms.366&#160;This&#160;<br/>closure system includes a web of Israeli military checkpoints, blockades, blocked roads, gates and the&#160;<br/>winding fence/wall. In addition to curtailing movement between Palestinian communities, it separates&#160;<br/>Palestinians from their agricultural land, and hampers Palestinians’ access to basic services, such as&#160;<br/>education and healthcare, and to work.

<a name=97></a>Affairs (OCHA), between January and February 2020 the Israeli military maintained 593 fixed permanent&#160;<br/>obstacles, such as checkpoints, earth mounds and road gates in the West Bank.367<br/>
Since March 2015, Israel has generally allowed women aged over 50 and men aged over 55 from the West&#160;<br/>Bank to enter Jerusalem or Israel without permits, but only if they have no “security” record or ban.368&#160;<br/>Meanwhile, Palestinians from the Gaza Strip can enter the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, only for&#160;<br/>urgent and life-threatening medical conditions, essential business and exceptional humanitarian reasons&#160;<br/>under Israel’s military “separation policy” between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where movement&#160;<br/>between the two areas has been severely restricted over the years and is considered to be the most extreme&#160;<br/>separation in the OPT.369&#160;Palestinians must obtain Israeli military permits – which has become virtually&#160;<br/>impossible to do – in order to travel between the areas, with no clear procedure for making an application or&#160;<br/>obtaining an outcome.<br/>
The permits regime, part of the multi-layered closure system, is a military, bureaucratic and arbitrary&#160;<br/>procedure that involves the Israeli Civil Administration issuing over 100 types of permits.370&#160;The regime&#160;<br/>applies only to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It does not apply to Jewish settlers, Israeli&#160;<br/>citizens or foreign nationals, who generally can move freely within the West Bank and between the West&#160;<br/>Bank and Israel except when Israeli authorities temporarily restrict their&#160;movement for specific reasons, such&#160;<br/>as Israeli national or Jewish religious holidays. In such cases, the Israeli army declares “general closures” in&#160;<br/>the West Bank, and no movement is allowed for Palestinians through checkpoints into East Jerusalem and&#160;<br/>Israel, as well as through other checkpoints between Palestinian areas near Israel, except for emergencies.&#160;<br/>However, when checkpoints are closed it is difficult and time-consuming for Palestinians to contact the&#160;<br/>appropriate Israeli army officials to notify them of an emergency and&#160;obtain authorization to pass.<br/>
Within the West Bank, Palestinians are prohibited from entering Israeli settlements except as workers bearing&#160;<br/>required permits.371&#160;The Israeli military declares the jurisdictional boundaries of settlements as closed or&#160;<br/>restricted areas, which only Palestinians are prohibited from entering. At the same time, the 700km fence/<br/>wall that Israel began constructing in 2002 mostly illegally on Palestinian land inside the occupied West&#160;<br/>Bank, of which 465km is completed,372&#160;has isolated 38 Palestinian localities that together cover 9.4% of the&#160;<br/>area of the West Bank,373&#160;and has trapped them in enclaves known as “seam zones”. These are sections of&#160;<br/>Palestinian land within the West Bank that fall between the fence/wall and the Green Line and are therefore&#160;<br/>severed from the OPT. Israel’s military commander declared “seam zones” as closed military zones.374&#160;As&#160;<br/>a result, all Palestinian residents of these localities or Palestinians who want to visit have to obtain special&#160;<br/>permits for entry and exit to their homes and acquire separate permits to access their agricultural land&#160;<br/>(see section 5.5.2 “Discriminatory allocation of resources”).375&#160;In the declaration, the military commander&#160;<br/>exempted Jewish settlers, Israeli citizens and foreign nationals from these restrictions. Israel also maintains&#160;<br/>a network of roads in the West Bank where Palestinian vehicles are either fully or partially restricted from&#160;<br/>

In 2002, the Israeli government passed Government Resolution 1813 prohibiting Palestinians from the West&#160;<br/>Bank and Gaza from gaining status in Israel or occupied East Jerusalem through marriage, thus preventing&#160;<br/>family unification.378&#160;A year later, Israel passed the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, which barred family&#160;<br/>unification for thousands of Palestinians in Israel and East Jerusalem&#160;with their Palestinian spouses from&#160;<br/>the West Bank and Gaza.379&#160;Then minister of interior Avraham Poraz stated that the government decision to&#160;<br/>freeze family unification in March 2003 was taken because “it was felt that it [family unification] would be&#160;<br/>exploited to achieve a creeping right of return… That is tens of thousands of Palestinian Arabs are coming&#160;<br/>into the State of Israel.”380<br/>
The law, which was a temporary order, had to be extended annually by the Knesset. This happened&#160;<br/>successfully until 6 July 2021 when, for party political reasons, the opposition in parliament led by former&#160;<br/>prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted against an extension to undermine the governing coalition.381&#160;<br/>In justifying voting against the extension of the law, Benjamin Netanyahu said the vote “halted [prime&#160;<br/>minister Naftali] Bennett and [interior minister Ayelet] Shaked’s attempt to sell the country to [Ra’am chair]&#160;<br/>Mansour Abbas and grant citizenship to thousands of Palestinians.”382&#160;This was in reference to a deal Naftali&#160;<br/>Bennett had reached with the Islamic Party of the South (Ra’am) whereby the latter agreed to support the&#160;<br/>extension of the law in return for the proposed extension being reduced to six months, the approval of 1,600&#160;<br/>applications from Palestinian families for temporary residency in Israel and the establishment of a committee&#160;<br/>to look into granting military-issued permits to 9,700 Palestinians residing in Israel.383&#160;<br/>
However, the government’s failure to pass the extension did not change the policy. Following the vote,&#160;<br/>interior minister Ayelet Shaked issued instructions not to accept family unification applications from&#160;<br/>

<a name=99></a>Palestinians until new or similar legislation was put in place.384&#160;She also vowed to bring the temporary law&#160;<br/>back to the Knesset for another vote to extend it.385&#160;Members of the opposition who support the policy of&#160;<br/>barring Palestinian family unification but had tactically voted against&#160;the extension said they intended to&#160;<br/>legislate a Basic Law for immigration that would ensure that Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza are&#160;<br/>permanently prevented from obtaining citizenship.386&#160;Indeed, a first attempt at passing such a law was made&#160;<br/>soon after the vote against extending the temporary order, although it failed.387<br/>
In line with the instructions, applications by Palestinian couples for family unification were not processed by&#160;<br/>the Ministry of Interior, according to media reports in October 2021.388&#160;Meanwhile a petition filed by Israeli&#160;<br/>human rights organizations urging the Court for Administrative Affairs to compel the Ministry of Interior to&#160;<br/>process “requests for status” was still pending as of the end of August 2021.389&#160;&#160;<br/>
The 2003 law, which was in effect for 18 years, did not allow spouses from the occupied West Bank and&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip to receive permanent residency or Israeli citizenship. Instead, “successful” applicants would&#160;<br/>receive temporary six-month permits to enter Israel or East Jerusalem to live with their spouses. The law was&#160;<br/>blatantly discriminatory against Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of East Jerusalem by denying their&#160;<br/>right to live with their spouses and families in their own country if they married a Palestinian from the OPT,&#160;<br/>while explicitly excluding residents of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.390<br/>
In 2005, Israel introduced an amendment to the law permitting the Ministry of Interior to reject applications&#160;<br/>if the “… applicant is liable to constitute a security risk to the State of&#160;Israel…”391&#160;Based on this amendment,&#160;<br/>in June 2008 Israel imposed a sweeping prohibition on the approval of residency permits for people&#160;<br/>registered as Gaza residents, even if they lived in the West Bank, and for anyone else residing in the Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip, based on the argument that “the Gaza Strip is a region where activity which may endanger the security&#160;<br/>of the State of Israel and its citizens takes place”, and as such it is difficult for the government to conduct&#160;<br/>individual security assessments of family unification applicants.392<br/>
Additional amendments over the years broadened the law’s scope to&#160;limit and deny family reunification for&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel.393&#160;In 2007, an amendment expanded the ban on family unification to spouses&#160;<br/>from Syria and Lebanon, both of which have substantial Palestinian refugee populations, as well as Iraq&#160;<br/>and Iran, all of which Israel considers to be “enemy states”. The exclusion included spouses from these&#160;<br/>states with dual nationality. The amendment also allowed the Israeli minister of interior to grant permits&#160;<br/>

<a name=100></a>and temporary residence in Israel for exceptional humanitarian reasons. The Exceptional Cases Committee&#160;<br/>was set up to consider individual cases on a “humanitarian” basis, but it was not made clear what this&#160;<br/>entailed.394&#160;The five-person committee, which included representatives from&#160;the Ministry of Defense, the&#160;<br/>General Security Services (Shin Bet) and the Population Registry, interpreted the law very narrowly. In fact,&#160;<br/>the committee only granted relief in a few cases, after very long delays and usually only because the case&#160;<br/>had been brought before the Supreme Court of Israel.395<br/>
According to information from the Israeli Ministry of Interior dated September 2013, between January 2000&#160;<br/>and July 2013 some 43% of family unification applications were rejected. Of these, 20% were rejected for&#160;<br/>security reasons and 13% because of lack of proof of “centre of life”. Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>submitted a total of 12,284 family unification applications, of which 5,629 were approved and 4,249 were&#160;<br/>rejected. The rest were postponed or delayed.396&#160;&#160;<br/>
As stated above (see section 5.3.1 “Denial of right to equal nationality and status”), the Ministry of Interior&#160;<br/>also requires children under the age of 12 of these “mixed couples” to be registered, with proof that Israel&#160;<br/>is their “centre of life”.397&#160;According to the Society of St Yves, a legal support centre in East Jerusalem, from&#160;<br/>January 2004 to July 2013 the ministry received 17,616 applications for registering children of “mixed&#160;<br/>marriages”. Of these, 12,247 were approved and 3,933 were rejected. As a result, nearly 4,000 children&#160;<br/>live separated from at least one of their parents for bureaucratic reasons. The number of children who live in&#160;<br/>Jerusalem or elsewhere in the OPT without any official administrative status is likely to be much higher, since&#160;<br/>the statistics above only represent cases where the parents attempted to complete the residency procedures.&#160;<br/>Many parents are discouraged by the complexity and uncertainty of the process, so do not attempt to resolve&#160;<br/>the status of their children.398<br/>
Although Israeli authorities have traditionally justified the policy as necessary on “security grounds”, they&#160;<br/>continue to implement it in a blanket manner without specific evidence-based reasons after almost two&#160;<br/>decades.399&#160;Statements by Israeli officials have made it clear that demographic – rather than security –&#160;<br/>considerations underpin the policy.400&#160;For example, in its presentation to the Israeli cabinet ahead of the&#160;<br/>government vote on the decision to freeze family unification for Palestinian spouses in May 2002, the&#160;<br/>Population Administration referred to “the immigration of non-Jews from around the world and primarily from&#160;<br/>neighbouring Arab countries and areas of the Palestinian Authority” as “an economic burden on the State&#160;<br/>of Israel and primarily a demographic burden.” It concluded: “The growing number of alien Palestinians&#160;<br/>obtaining legal status in Israel requires review and statutory change.”401&#160;In a debate in the Knesset after&#160;<br/>the government decision to freeze family unification, government minister Dani Naveh stated that family&#160;<br/>unification of Palestinians was “… an attempt to realize the so-called&#160;right of return through the back door”&#160;<br/>and that the State of Israel “… clearly has the elemental right to protect itself and preserve its character as a&#160;<br/>Jewish state, as the state of the Jewish people…”402<br/>

<a name=101></a>Politicians who consider themselves centrist are among those who oppose granting family unification to&#160;<br/>Palestinians and voted for the extension of the law.403&#160;In the run-up to the vote on 6 July 2021, foreign&#160;<br/>minister Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid political party, said approvingly: “There is no need to hide from&#160;<br/>the essence of the reunification law. It is one of the tools designed to ensure a Jewish majority&#160;in the State of&#160;<br/>Israel.”404&#160;Defence minister Benny Gantz, head of the Kahol Lvan (Blue and White) political party, said: “This&#160;<br/>law is essential for safeguarding the country’s security and Jewish and democratic character.”405<br/>
The law reflected Israel’s long-standing policy aimed at restricting the number of Palestinians who are&#160;<br/>allowed to live in Israel and East Jerusalem.406&#160;Several petitions by local human rights organizations&#160;<br/>challenging the constitutionality of the law before the Supreme Court of Israel in 2006 and 2012 failed.407&#160;<br/>The court concluded that the law was justified for “security reasons”&#160;and was constitutional.408&#160;In effect,&#160;<br/>these judgments enabled the renewal of a temporary order for 18 years. Meanwhile, international human&#160;<br/>rights bodies, including CERD and the CESCR, for years expressed concerns over the discriminatory nature&#160;<br/>of the law and called on Israel to revoke it.409<br/>
Israel’s implementation of the policy barring Palestinian family unification in a blanket manner constitutes&#160;<br/>a systematic denial of basic rights, including the rights to nationality and status, freedom of movement,&#160;<br/>work, health, education, and family life. The policy has affected thousands of families and forced them to&#160;<br/>live apart, abroad or in constant fear of being arrested, expelled or deported. The implementation of this&#160;<br/>discriminatory policy is a clear example of how Israel fragments Palestinians into different domains of control&#160;<br/>to treat them differently, or segregate them, from the Jewish population, and subjugates their rights to the&#160;<br/>aim of maintaining a Jewish majority in Israel.&#160;<br/>

<a name=102></a>documentation in Lod, unable to freely move or access healthcare or other social rights. She lived every&#160;<br/>day fearing arrest, expulsion and/or separation from her spouse. Later, this dread of being separated&#160;<br/>from her spouse extended to her children. It was during this time that she gave birth to her first two&#160;<br/>sons. She told Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>There was a constant fear in my life. I was terrified of getting sick for&#160;example, because of this&#160;<br/>fear of having to go to the hospital without the necessary documents, getting caught [by Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities], and paying lots of money to cover for any kind of procedure or treatment… How was&#160;<br/>I expected to navigate all of that pressure while being recently married&#160;and about to have my first&#160;<br/>and second children?</i><br/>
H. S. also described her constant state of fear and anxiety while visiting her family in the West Bank:&#160;<br/>
<i>When I wanted to visit my family in the West Bank, sometimes I would go there and spend a&#160;<br/>month or two, as that is much easier than having to keep going back and forth. I remember&#160;<br/>once during the Eid holiday, Israeli soldiers put up a “flying checkpoint”411&#160;right before we were&#160;<br/>supposed to enter Ramallah. At the time I did not have a permit and we were stopped ¬– it was a&#160;<br/>disaster. We had taken a taxi at the time since we did not have a car, and we did not want to risk&#160;<br/>using public transport, for the same reason we were stopped, to avoid random checks. I was eight&#160;<br/>months pregnant at the time. They [Israeli officers] stopped us and&#160;realized that I had no legal&#160;<br/>documents to be in this area, so they penalized the taxi driver and I was detained at the military&#160;<br/>base near Qalandia checkpoint.</i><br/>
When she turned 25, H. S. applied for family unification. In 2009, she received a permit allowing her to&#160;<br/>live with her family in Israel, which she is required to renew every year. She told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>Even though it technically lasts a year, as early as after the first six months elapse, we will have&#160;<br/>to start gathering papers, documents, [and] proofs in order to apply for a new permit. We have&#160;<br/>folders with documents on top of documents with monthly bills, receipts, rent payments, health&#160;<br/>insurance papers, work pay slips for my husband, registration of my kids in schools, phone bills,&#160;<br/>and more.&#160;</i><br/>
<b>N. J. (East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank)</b><br/>
N. J., a Palestinian resident of Jerusalem from Silwan, married A. F, from Al-Arroub refugee camp near&#160;<br/>Hebron in the south of the West Bank, in 1983. They have six children, all of them now adults. The&#160;<br/>family lived in Al-Arroub refugee camp and in 1994 they filed a family&#160;unification request in order to live&#160;<br/>in Jerusalem. Their application was rejected on security grounds. They hired a lawyer to appeal, but&#160;<br/>their appeal was also rejected. As a result, N. J. had to quit her job in Jerusalem and went to live with&#160;<br/>her family in Al-Arroub.&#160;<br/>
In 2008, the couple divorced and N. J. moved back to live in Jerusalem. While trying to renew her&#160;<br/>permanent residency card that year, the Israeli Ministry of Interior rejected her application and informed&#160;<br/>her that her residency has been revoked because she failed to meet the “centre of life” requirements.&#160;<br/>Since then, N. J. has been engaged in a legal process to renew her permanent residency status –&#160;<br/>without success as of 31 July 2021. Having no permit to stay in Jerusalem or move freely, she has&#160;<br/>been confined to Jerusalem and is unable to go to the rest of the West Bank for fear of being arrested&#160;<br/>and expelled from Jerusalem if she is stopped at any of the numerous Israeli checkpoints surrounding&#160;<br/>the city. The revocation of her permanent residency has also severely restricted her ability to see her&#160;<br/>children, all of whom carry West Bank Palestinian identity cards, which do not grant them access to&#160;<br/>Jerusalem to visit their mother. Prior to 2008 and her divorce, she was able to see her children at their&#160;<br/>

<a name=103></a>paternal grandmother’s house in the West Bank city of Jericho. This is no longer an option. N. J. told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>Since 2008, I have not been able to see my children as I please, because I cannot cross Israeli&#160;<br/>military checkpoints. I can only see my children and grandchildren through video calls. I have&#160;<br/>spent 12 years of my life trying to solve this, but the [Israeli] authorities keep stalling. I have&#160;<br/>spent half of my life either at the Ministry of Interior offices or gathering papers for them. This is&#160;<br/>exhausting. I am unable to see my sons and daughters enough and this makes it harder. Seeing&#160;<br/>them makes everything better, and I cannot have that. I keep reminding myself that at least I was&#160;<br/>able to be with them while they were growing up, when most of them attended university, and I&#160;<br/>was lucky enough to attend some of their weddings.412</i><br/>
<b>Bassam Allan (East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank)&#160;</b><br/>
Bassam Allan, from the West Bank village of Sawahreh, married Sawasan Allan, a Palestinian resident&#160;<br/>of Jerusalem, in 2008. That year, he obtained a permit to reside in East Jerusalem, and they lived in the&#160;<br/>neighbourhood of Jabal Al-Mukabbir until 2017. The couple have five children aged under 18.&#160;<br/>
Sawasan Allan is a distant relative of Fadi Al-Qunbar, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem who killed four&#160;<br/>Israeli soldiers in a ramming attack in Jerusalem on 8 January 2017. In the aftermath of the attack,&#160;<br/>then Israeli interior minister Aryeh Deri revoked the residency permits of 14 family members of Fadi&#160;<br/>Al-Qunbar, including Bassam Allan, stating: “Let this be known to all who are plotting, planning or&#160;<br/>considering carrying out an attack, that their families will pay a heavy price for their actions and the&#160;<br/>consequences will be severe and far-reaching.”413<br/>
On 12 January 2017, just four days after the attack, Bassam Allan was called into the Abu Ghniem&#160;<br/>police station in Jerusalem where he was questioned about his relationship to Fadi Al-Qunbar. He was&#160;<br/>then summoned to the Ministry of Interior in January 2017 where he was accused of being a member&#160;<br/>of the Islamic State armed group and subsequently had his residency permit cancelled. He told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>I have been living in Jabal Al-Mukabbir for 12 years on the basis of my residency permit. I had to&#160;<br/>renew my permit every six months, and for each renewal I needed to go to the Ministry of Interior&#160;<br/>with my bills and paperwork to prove that I was living in Jabal Al-Mukabbir. It is a very tiring and&#160;<br/>very costly process.414</i><br/>
He added:&#160;<br/>
<i>Israeli forces also raided our house several times, including in 2017 claiming they were searching&#160;<br/>for security threats. The Ministry of Interior is using the deterrence excuse to kick us out. I&#160;<br/>remember when I signed the papers for the residency permit, there were clauses that said that&#160;<br/>permits will be cancelled if the permit holder or first-degree relative commits a security offence.&#160;<br/>But they are now doing this to me, even though my wife is a distant relative [of Fadi Al-Qunbar].</i><br/>
On 12 December 2017, an Israeli court found the allegations that Bassam Allan was a member of&#160;<br/>Islamic State to be baseless and allowed him to remain in Jerusalem on an interim order that permits&#160;<br/>him to stay in Jerusalem and move freely but not to work or enjoy benefits associated with residency&#160;<br/>until the end of the legal proceedings. Another court order, issued on 6 August 2020, enabled him to&#160;<br/>move within Jerusalem without the risk of arrest until the end of the legal proceedings. Bassam Allan&#160;<br/>has no right to work, receive national health insurance or obtain a driver’s licence in Jerusalem, which&#160;<br/>are rights reserved to people with residency status.

<i>Although I have an order allowing me to stay in Jerusalem, Israeli officers sometimes do not care&#160;<br/>or maybe do not understand what it means. I was arrested several times, even after showing the&#160;<br/>order, and was taken to a police station before being dropped off at a checkpoint on the West&#160;<br/>Bank side [behind the wall where it separates East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank]. The&#160;<br/>last time I was stopped by the police was [in April 2020], when I was just a few metres away from&#160;<br/>my home. I showed my order and tried to explain to the officers, but&#160;they did not care. They first&#160;<br/>took me to the police station in Jabal Al-Mukabbir [where Bassam lives with his family] and then to&#160;<br/>a checkpoint in Bethlehem [which is 9km from his home], although Sheikh Sa’ed checkpoint was&#160;<br/>closer, but I think they wanted to punish me.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Nowadays, I have been staying home a lot. I do not even go out to buy groceries, because even&#160;<br/>though I have the necessary papers to allow me to stay, the police do not care and are looking for&#160;<br/>people like me.</i><br/>
<i>This situation has cost me a lot. If the legal proceedings do not end in my favour, I have nowhere&#160;<br/>to go. But I will stay in my house with my kids. My mother and siblings live in Sawahreh, but I do&#160;<br/>not have my own place there. I used to go visit a lot before 2017 but now I arrange for my elderly&#160;<br/>and ill mother to come and visit me in Jerusalem. I only see my siblings when they have permits&#160;<br/>[to access Jerusalem] and are able to visit. Otherwise, I do not see them.</i><br/>
Bassam Allan explained the implications of the revocation of his residency permit on his life and his&#160;<br/>ability to find employment:&#160;<br/>
<i>Since it began, this whole situation with the family unification process has been extremely difficult,&#160;<br/>but nothing compares to the suffering I am going through now without a permit. Since my permit was&#160;<br/>cancelled in 2017, I have not been able to find work in a sustained&#160;manner. I work in construction.&#160;<br/>The drivers who take workers like me in their cars refuse to take me because I do not have a permit.&#160;<br/>They worry they will get arrested and fined if they are caught with a&#160;worker without a permit. It has&#160;<br/>been especially difficult in the last four months; I have not had any work at all and [have] been&#160;<br/>borrowing money from friends and relatives just to get by. The debt just keeps on increasing.</i><br/>

<a name=105></a><b>5.3.4 USE OF MILITARY RULE<br/></b>Since Israel’s creation in 1948, Israel has used military administration over different groups of Palestinians in&#160;<br/>the territories that formed British mandate Palestine continuously – with the exception of a seven-month gap&#160;<br/>in 1967 – to advance Jewish settlement in areas of strategic importance and to dispossess Palestinians of&#160;<br/>their land and property under the guise of maintaining security.&#160;<br/>
In September 1948, Israel announced the establishment of military rule over those territories that had been&#160;<br/>designated to form an Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan over which it had taken control. Other&#160;<br/>areas inhabited by Palestinians were also placed under military rule soon after. Eventually, some 85% of the&#160;<br/>newly created state’s Palestinian population was subjected to military rule in three districts: North, which&#160;<br/>included the Galilee; Centre, which covered the Triangle region; and South, which comprised the Negev/<br/>Naqab.415&#160;The borders of these districts were drawn up to include as many Palestinian communities and to&#160;<br/>exclude as many Jewish communities as possible.416<br/>
David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister and former head of the World Zionist Organization, explained&#160;<br/>that “the military regime came into existence to protect the right of Jewish settlement in all parts of the&#160;<br/>state.”417&#160;A recently published secret annex to a 1956 report on the military rule inside Israel went even&#160;<br/>further by stating that the army alone could not protect state lands from Palestinians wishing to return to&#160;<br/>their homes and that, in the long run, these could only be protected through Jewish settlement. As a result,&#160;<br/>continued military rule over Palestinians was necessary to establish Jewish settlements in all three districts&#160;<br/>overseen by the military regime.418<br/>
The military administration of Palestinians was based on the declaration of a state of emergency and the&#160;<br/>Defence (Emergency) Regulations, enacted by the British Mandate in Palestine in 1945, which were used to&#160;<br/>control the movement of residents, confiscate property, allow for the&#160;closure of villages,419&#160;house demolitions,&#160;<br/>and crucially, prevent Palestinians from returning to their homes and repopulating their villages.420&#160;The&#160;<br/>imposition of martial law deliberately restricted the movement of Palestinians within Israel, who were&#160;<br/>subjected to night-time curfews and required to obtain permits to leave their areas of residence, including&#160;<br/>to access medical care,421&#160;and excluded Palestinians from employment in security-related jobs,422&#160;under the&#160;<br/>pretext of the state of emergency.423&#160;Israeli state institutions worked during this period to place Palestinians&#160;<br/>under a system of surveillance and control that also deliberately restricted political freedoms424&#160;by banning&#160;<br/>protests, arresting political activists and barring them from their homes (and as a result, their livelihoods as&#160;<br/>well) under “exile orders” on account of their political activities.425<br/>
While other non-Jewish Israeli citizens, primarily Circassians and Druze, were also placed under martial law,&#160;<br/>they were treated more favourably by the Israeli government as some of them fought alongside Israeli forces&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=106></a>during the war that led to the creation of Israel.426&#160;David Ben-Gurion declared in 1949: “In this country there&#160;<br/>are minorities that are above all suspicion and it is possible to trust them, more or less, like the Circassians&#160;<br/>and the Druze.”427&#160;The Druze minority was exempted from the restrictions on movement when Israel&#160;<br/>imposed martial law on them, which it terminated in 1962.428<br/>
Israel abolished its military rule over Palestinian citizens in December 1966 after it had successfully&#160;<br/>prevented internally displaced Palestinians from returning to their homes in empty villages by destroying&#160;<br/>them, and parcelling out their land and subjecting it to forestation, thus removing the need to maintain&#160;<br/>their status as closed military zones.429&#160;While restrictions on movement were progressively removed, other&#160;<br/>elements of the system remained. The 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations were not repealed and&#160;<br/>instead were enforced against Palestinian citizens of Israel by Israel’s civilian institutions such as the Israel&#160;<br/>Police, Israel Security Agency (also known as Shabak or Shin Bet) and the Land Administration. Equally,&#160;<br/>some areas where the appropriation of Palestinian land had not been completed remained closed until they&#160;<br/>met “certain conditions”, which included the “demolition of structures in abandoned villages, forestation and&#160;<br/>declaration of nature reserves”.430<br/>
Eventually, the situation of Palestinians inside the Green Line improved following Israel’s occupation of the&#160;<br/>West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Israel imposed a brutal military rule through many of the laws and policies&#160;<br/>used against Palestinians in Israel. According to Akevot, “the experience accumulated from operating the&#160;<br/>Military Rule inside Israel, which was translated into several operative military plans, along with the Defence&#160;<br/>(Emergency) Regulations, formed the basis for the Military Administration Israel instituted in the territories&#160;<br/>occupied in June 1967.”431&#160;Importantly, the unit within the Israeli army which administered military rule over&#160;<br/>Palestinians in Israel was never disbanded after 1966; it was merely renamed and eventually became the&#160;<br/>Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), a unit within the Ministry of Defense tasked&#160;<br/>with administering civilian matters in the OPT until today. Indeed, Akevot notes that “the various incarnations&#160;<br/>of control over civilians pursuant to military powers (inside Israel until December 1966, a seven-month hiatus&#160;<br/>and then from June 7, 1967, to the present day in the Occupied Territories) have always been handled by a&#160;<br/>single organic unit that was never disbanded but merely renamed to suit the circumstances.”432<br/>
&#160;Following the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli military authorities issued a&#160;<br/>proclamation that enabled them to use the 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations against the population&#160;<br/>living in these territories. Over the years, Israel resorted to these regulations extensively to quash&#160;<br/>resistance to its military occupation by demolishing or sealing hundreds of houses, deporting residents, or&#160;<br/>administratively detaining tens of thousands of people.433<br/>
Since the late 1970s, Israel has extraterritorially extended its civil law over Israeli citizens residing in or&#160;<br/>travelling through the OPT on the basis of the Emergency Regulations Law (West Bank and Gaza – Criminal&#160;<br/>Jurisdiction and Legal Assistance) 1967. This enables the Israeli authorities to exempt Israeli citizens from&#160;<br/>

<a name=107></a>the military orders governing Palestinians.434&#160;This law is also applicable to foreign nationals who move to&#160;<br/>settlements even if they are not Israeli citizens.435&#160;Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank are brought&#160;<br/>before Israeli civilian courts, rather than Israeli military courts, as a matter of policy.<br/>
More than 1,800 Israeli military orders&#160;436&#160;continue to control and restrict all aspects of the lives of&#160;<br/>Palestinians in the West Bank: their livelihoods, status, movement and access to natural resources.437&#160;<br/>Further, Israeli military orders severely and arbitrarily violate the enjoyment of their rights to freedom of&#160;<br/>expression, association and peaceful assembly, particularly when Palestinians protest against the policies of&#160;<br/>the occupation.&#160;<br/>
For example, just two months after its occupation of the Palestinian territories, Israel issued Military Order&#160;<br/>101: Order Regarding Prohibition of Incitement and Hostile Propaganda Actions, which punishes and&#160;<br/>criminalizes Palestinians for attending and organizing a procession, assembly or vigil of 10 or more people&#160;<br/>without a permit for an issue that “may be construed as political”. The order, which does not define what is&#160;<br/>meant by “political”, effectively bans protests, including peaceful protests.438&#160;It also prohibits the display of&#160;<br/>flags or emblems or the publication of any material “having a political significance” without a permit from an&#160;<br/>Israeli military commander. Anyone breaching the order faces up to 10 years’ imprisonment and/or a hefty&#160;<br/>fine. The order continues to apply in the West Bank.<br/>
Israeli military legislation in the West Bank is enforced by the military justice system, particularly military orders&#160;<br/>defining criminal “security offences”. Israeli military courts,&#160;which had been used to try Palestinian citizens of&#160;<br/>Israel when they were subjected to military rule between 1948 and 1966, were established for the OPT on the&#160;<br/>first&#160;day&#160;of&#160;Israel’s&#160;military&#160;occupation&#160;on&#160;7&#160;June&#160;1967&#160;under&#160;the&#160;Defence&#160;(Emergency)&#160;Regulations.439&#160;In 2010,&#160;<br/>Military Order 1651 came into effect, consolidated a number of military orders relating to the establishment and&#160;<br/>legal procedures of military courts, and defined criminal “security offences”.440&#160;The military justice system has&#160;<br/>a very high conviction rate. According to data in the military courts’ annual report for 2010, 99.74% of cases&#160;<br/>heard in military courts in the occupied West Bank ended in conviction.441&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, Palestinians from the Gaza Strip were subjected to Israeli military legislation and tried before&#160;<br/>military courts until Israel dismantled its settlements in 2005, and ground forces were withdrawn. This marked&#160;<br/>the end of most aspects of Israeli military rule of Gaza’s civilian population, although elements of Israeli military&#160;<br/>law continue to apply to the area with regards to the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, access&#160;<br/>to territorial waters and the “buffer zone” along the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Since 2005, however,&#160;<br/>Gaza’s residents arrested by Israel are prosecuted under security legislation before civil courts.442<br/>
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the OPT have been arrested in the context of military rule,&#160;<br/>including many protesting against Israel’s military laws and policies. According to an estimate released&#160;<br/>by Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association (Addameer) in 2016, Israel’s authorities&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a>had arrested over 800,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip since&#160;<br/>1967.443&#160;&#160;<br/>
Israel has also maintained a policy of forcibly transferring Palestinian prisoners from the OPT to prisons&#160;<br/>inside Israel, a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law (see section 6.1 “Forcible transfer”).444&#160;<br/>Some 4,236 Palestinians from the OPT, including 267 from the Gaza Strip, were held in Israeli prisons at the&#160;<br/>end of May 2020, according to the Israel Prison Service.445&#160;<br/>
<b>5.3.5 RESTRICTIONS ON RIGHT TO POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND&#160;<br/>POPULAR RESISTANCE<br/></b>As a result of their citizenship status, Palestinian citizens of Israel are the only group of Palestinians living&#160;<br/>under Israel’s rule who can vote in its national and municipal elections and be elected as members of&#160;<br/>the Knesset. However, while Israeli laws and policies define the state as democratic, the fragmentation&#160;<br/>of the Palestinian people ensures that Israel’s version of democracy overwhelmingly privileges political&#160;<br/>participation by Jewish Israelis.446&#160;In addition, the representation of Palestinian citizens of Israel in the&#160;<br/>decision-making&#160;process, primarily in the Knesset, has been restricted and undermined by an array of Israeli&#160;<br/>laws and policies.<br/>
Most importantly, Israel’s constitutional law prevents Israeli citizens&#160;from challenging the definition of Israel&#160;<br/>as a Jewish state and in effect any laws that establish such an identity. Under Israel’s Basic Law: The&#160;<br/>Knesset of 1958, the Central Elections Committee can disqualify a party or candidate from participation in&#160;<br/>elections if their objectives or actions are meant to negate the definition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic&#160;<br/>state; incite racism; or support armed struggles by a hostile state or a terrorist organization against Israel.447&#160;<br/>In addition, the 1992 Law on Political Parties prohibits the registration of any party whose goals or actions&#160;<br/>deny either directly or indirectly “the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state”.448&#160; These&#160;<br/>provisions prevent Palestinian lawmakers from challenging laws that codify Jewish Israeli domination over&#160;<br/>the Palestinian minority, unduly limit their freedom of expression and, as a result, impede their ability to&#160;<br/>represent the concerns of their constituents effectively. They have also been the basis for repeated and&#160;<br/>persistent attempts to disqualify Palestinian parties and candidates from running in successive legislative&#160;<br/>elections, although these have generally not been successful.449&#160;Over the years the Central Elections&#160;<br/>Committee has taken decisions to ban Palestinian parties and disqualify Palestinian candidates for violating&#160;<br/>these provisions and then seen the Supreme Court overturn them.450&#160;The committee has also rejected&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=109></a>requests to disqualify Jewish Israeli members of the Knesset for incitement to racism and then seen the&#160;<br/>Supreme Court order their disqualification.451<br/>
In 2014, the Knesset raised the electoral threshold from 2% to 3.25%, primarily affecting parliamentary&#160;<br/>representation of Palestinians and other minority groups in Israel. Adalah and ACRI argued that raising the&#160;<br/>electoral threshold for parties to gain seats at the Knesset violated Palestinian citizens’ voting rights and&#160;<br/>enabled the disqualification of their candidates and parties.452&#160;CERD also noted that raising the electoral&#160;<br/>threshold in Israel considerably weakens “the right to political participation of non-Jewish minorities”.453&#160;<br/>
Palestinian Knesset members have been subjected to repeated smear campaigns and intimidation by&#160;<br/>government ministers, in addition to judicial harassment in their struggle for equality, and for expressing&#160;<br/>support for popular resistance to the Israeli occupation and other political views that challenge the&#160;<br/>established narrative of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.454&#160;They have also faced discriminatory&#160;<br/>disciplinary measures that violate their freedom of opinion and expression. For example, in 2016, the Ethics&#160;<br/>Committee suspended three Palestinian Knesset members for meeting families of Palestinian civilians who&#160;<br/>had been killed by Israeli forces for attacking or allegedly attacking Israelis even though the purpose of the&#160;<br/>meeting was to help these families retrieve the dead bodies of their relatives. Meanwhile, Jewish members&#160;<br/>of the Knesset have not faced such repercussions for meeting families of Jewish civilians who carried out&#160;<br/>violent attacks against Palestinians.455<br/>
The Knesset also regularly disqualifies bills related to Palestinians’ rights or political aspirations in Israel.456&#160;<br/>For example, during the legislative process leading to the adoption of the nation state law on 19 July&#160;<br/>2018, Palestinian members of the Knesset proposed a bill in June 2018&#160;offering an alternative definition&#160;<br/>of Israel as “a country for all its citizens”. The bill included several articles that were meant to alter the&#160;<br/>character of Israel from a state of the Jewish people to a state in which Jews and Arabs enjoy equal status&#160;<br/>in terms of nationality. In response, the Knesset Presidium, a body comprising the Knesset’s speaker&#160;<br/>and deputy speakers, prevented the bill from even being discussed, arguing that it would negate Israel’s&#160;<br/>definition as a Jewish state.457&#160;In June 2018, Adalah challenged the decision to disqualify the bill, but the&#160;<br/>Supreme Court of Israel dismissed the challenge on 30 December 2018.458&#160;The court determined that the&#160;<br/>dissolution of the Knesset days earlier, on 26 December 2018, had rendered the petition theoretical and&#160;<br/>refrained from criticizing or commenting on the disqualification. These measures have impacted Palestinian&#160;<br/>parliamentarians in a discriminatory manner and consequently have eroded their right to equal political&#160;<br/>participation in Israel.<br/>
Limitations on the right of Palestinian citizens of Israel to participate in elections are accompanied by other&#160;<br/>infringements of their civil and political rights that limit the extent to which they can participate in the political&#160;<br/>
451.&#160;For example, ahead of the March 2019 national elections, the Central Elections Committee rejected a petition against Michael&#160;Ben Ari,&#160;<br/>
chairman of the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, thereby approving him to run in the election. However, the Supreme Court disqualified&#160;<br/>
him and banned him from running for the Knesset on grounds of incessant incitement against Arabs. See Haaretz, “Israel’s top&#160;court bans&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a>and social life of Israel. This has included racialized policing of protests, mass arbitrary arrests and the use&#160;<br/>of unlawful force against protesters during demonstrations against land dispossession inside Israel or Israeli&#160;<br/>violations against Palestinians in the OPT. Such measures, which target peaceful protesters, are aimed to&#160;<br/>deter further demonstrations and stifle dissent. Upon arrest, Palestinians are routinely placed in pretrial&#160;<br/>detention; by contrast, Jewish protesters are generally granted bail. This points to a discriminatory treatment&#160;<br/>of Palestinians by the criminal justice system, which appears to treat Palestinians as “suspects” instead of&#160;<br/>assessing the individual threat they pose. &#160;<br/>
In one such example, in September and October 2000, Israeli forces killed 13 Palestinian citizens, and&#160;<br/>injured hundreds of others during mass demonstrations that erupted across the country in protest at Israel’s&#160;<br/>brutal actions in the OPT following the outbreak of the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>. Although Israeli police forces,&#160;<br/>including snipers, were alleged to have used live ammunition, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas and a&#160;<br/>commission of inquiry found that the police used excessive force, the Israeli authorities failed to effectively&#160;<br/>investigate these killings and, to Amnesty International’s knowledge, no one was ever brought to justice&#160;<br/>(see section 6.3.2 “Israeli policies and practices”).459&#160;Over 1,000 demonstrators were arrested, many of&#160;<br/>them only for their peaceful participation in the protests. Palestinians constituted the vast majority of those&#160;<br/>detained and were accused of throwing stones, assaulting police officers, damaging property or public&#160;<br/>order offences such as participating in an unlawful assembly. Many, including children, were subjected to&#160;<br/>beatings and other ill-treatment during arrest and interrogation. Although the attorney general stated that&#160;<br/>all detainees regardless of their nationality were being remanded in custody, in reality, 89% of Palestinian&#160;<br/>detainees were denied bail until the end of proceedings, while only 11% of Jewish Israelis arrested were&#160;<br/>detained until the end of their trials.460&#160;This exemplified Israel’s approach to its Palestinian citizens&#160;as a “‘fifth&#160;<br/>column’ to be controlled and contained”.461&#160;Similarly, in December 2008-2009 Israeli police forces violently&#160;<br/>dispersed largely peaceful mass demonstrations against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, arresting some&#160;<br/>832 protesters. Many of them, including children, were targeted solely for their participation in the protests.&#160;<br/>Importantly, while 80% of all detainees, including children, were denied bail and held in custody until&#160;<br/>the end of the trial, the overwhelming majority were Palestinian citizens and residents of East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>According to Adalah, not a single detainee from the Tel Aviv district, which included the vast majority&#160;<br/>of Jewish protesters, was similarly detained until the end of legal proceedings, pointing to a pattern of&#160;<br/>discriminatory treatment of Palestinians detainees.462<br/>
In a more recent example, during demonstrations and protests that began in May 2021 – primarily against&#160;<br/>Israel’s plan to forcibly evict seven more Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem and&#160;<br/>its military operation in Gaza – the Israeli police carried out mass arrests, used excessive force against&#160;<br/>peaceful protesters, and tortured and otherwise ill-treated detainees.463&#160;This prompted solidarity protests&#160;<br/>by Palestinians to spread, including to towns with Palestinian populations inside Israel, and intercommunal&#160;<br/>violence broke out. Scores of people were injured, and two Jewish citizens of Israel and one Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizen were killed. Synagogues and Muslim cemeteries were vandalized. Armed hostilities broke out on&#160;<br/>10 May as Palestinian armed groups fired rockets into Israel from Gaza, and Israel launched an 11-day&#160;<br/>military offensive against the Gaza Strip. On 24 May, Israeli authorities launched “Operation Law and Order”&#160;<br/>primarily targeting Palestinian protesters. Israeli media said the operation aimed to “settle scores” with&#160;<br/>

<a name=111></a>those involved and to “deter” further demonstrations.464&#160;Israeli police also failed to protect Palestinians from&#160;<br/>organized attacks by groups of armed Jewish individuals, whose plans were often publicized in advance.465&#160;&#160;<br/>
According to the Mossawa Center – the Advocacy Center for Palestinian Arab Citizens in Israel (Mossawa&#160;<br/>Center), a human rights organization based in Haifa, between 10 May and 10 June 2021, Israeli police&#160;<br/>arrested more than 2,150 people, more than 90% of them Palestinian citizens of Israel or residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem. The group also said 184 indictments were filed against 285 defendants. According to Adalah,&#160;<br/>a representative of the State Attorney’s Office said on 27 May that only 30 Jewish citizens of Israel were&#160;<br/>among those indicted. Most Palestinians arrested were detained for offences such as “insulting or assaulting&#160;<br/>a police officer” or “taking part in an illegal gathering” rather than for&#160;violent attacks on people or property,&#160;<br/>according to the Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel.466<br/>
<b>PALESTINIAN POPULAR RESISTANCE IN OPT &#160;<br/></b>As stated above, Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian civil and political rights particularly in&#160;<br/>the West Bank, where military orders are still enforced. Israeli authorities have since 1967 outlawed&#160;<br/>more than 400 Palestinian organizations, including all major political parties and several prominent civil&#160;<br/>society organizations widely recognized for the provision of vital services such as legal aid and medical&#160;<br/>care as well as the quality of their human rights reporting and advocacy, most recently in October&#160;<br/>2021. In addition, the Israeli authorities often prosecute Palestinians for “membership and activity in&#160;<br/>an unlawful association”, a charge frequently levied against anti-occupation activists.467&#160;Over the years,&#160;<br/>they have arrested scores of Palestinian lawmakers, particularly following Hamas’s electoral victory in&#160;<br/>2006, placing them under administrative detention or prosecuting them in military courts in trials that&#160;<br/>fail to meet international standards, thus undermining Palestinian political life.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians in East Jerusalem, on the other hand, are neither able to participate in political life in&#160;<br/>Israel nor in the West Bank. Although they can vote and run in municipal elections in Jerusalem,&#160;<br/>they have traditionally boycotted them in protest at Israel’s ongoing occupation and illegal annexation&#160;<br/>annexation of East Jerusalem,468&#160;and they remain excluded from national elections. Meanwhile, the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities prevent any Palestinian political presence, including campaigning, in East Jerusalem,&#160;<br/>and have opposed Palestinian general elections being held in the city, despite this being guaranteed&#160;<br/>under the Oslo Accords. Most recently, they arrested two Hamas candidates and dispersed meetings in&#160;<br/>Jerusalem held ahead of elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council, which were scheduled to take&#160;<br/>place in May 2021 before President Mahmoud Abbas decided to postpone them indefinitely.469&#160;&#160;<br/>
As a result, protests remain for Palestinians the only means to influence Israeli politics and challenge&#160;<br/>the political reality in the OPT. Palestinians in the OPT have, over the years, mobilized and organized&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=112></a>popular resistance against Israel’s military occupation and expansion of settlements,470&#160;which has been&#160;<br/>systematically met with Israeli excessive and unlawful force, arbitrary arrests and prosecution in military&#160;<br/>courts, as well as undue restrictions on freedom of movement.&#160;<br/>
Most notable is the first&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;of 1987-93, which was brutally repressed.471&#160;A new and continued&#160;<br/>wave of popular mobilization began around 2002 when Israel began building the fence/wall, expanding&#160;<br/>illegal Israeli settlements and expropriating large swathes of land from Palestinian communities near&#160;<br/>the fence/wall and/or settlements. Communities in these areas began organizing protests against&#160;<br/>the land grab and the military rule that facilitates it on the one hand and oppresses Palestinian&#160;<br/>communities on the other. Some of the mobilizations in the villages took the form of weekly peaceful&#160;<br/>demonstrations.&#160;<br/>
<b>NABI SALEH &#160;</b><br/>
The village of Nabi Saleh near Ramallah has been a focus of demonstrations and activism against&#160;<br/>Israel’s military occupation and land appropriation for settlements. The neighbouring Israeli settlement&#160;<br/>of Halamish expropriated land from the village, including a water source. Israeli forces have repeatedly&#160;<br/>used excessive force in response to the protests and during search and arrest raids. Such actions have,&#160;<br/>since 2009, caused the deaths of four people in the village – Mustafa Tamimi, in December 2011;&#160;<br/>Rushdie Tamimi, in November 2012; Izz Al-Din Tamimi, in May 2017; and Saba’ Obaid, in June 2018 –&#160;<br/>and wounded hundreds of others, including children.&#160;<br/>
The Israeli authorities frequently declare the area a closed military zone, particularly during&#160;<br/>demonstrations, and close roads leading in and out of the village. This forces residents and visitors to&#160;<br/>enter and leave the village via military checkpoints, where many complain that Israeli soldiers harass&#160;<br/>them. Israeli soldiers have also deliberately damaged property such as residents’ water storage tanks&#160;<br/>located on rooftops.&#160;<br/>
The army frequently arrests local political activists and human rights defenders, and conducts night&#160;<br/>raids in the village, often arresting children accused mostly of throwing stones at Israeli troops. Israeli&#160;<br/>forces have also frequently attacked medics seeking to assist people who have been wounded in the&#160;<br/>response to the protests and journalists who are reporting on them, including&#160;by firing tear gas canisters&#160;<br/>and rubber-coated metal bullets.<br/>
The combined impact of the army’s repressive and restrictive policies and practices in Nabi Saleh&#160;<br/>appears to amount to collective punishment, whereby the population as a whole is penalized, including&#160;<br/>those who play no active part in the activism against Israeli rule. Collective punishment of protected&#160;<br/>persons in an occupied territory is prohibited under international humanitarian law and when imposed&#160;<br/>constitutes a war crime. It is also a serious violation of international human rights law.&#160;<br/>
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have also faced Israeli repression for their popular resistance against&#160;<br/>the occupation. As stated above, following the 2005 “disengagement”, they are no longer prosecuted&#160;<br/>under sweeping military orders that prohibit demonstrations and restrict free expression. However, they&#160;<br/>have been subjected to excessive and, often lethal, force during protests near the fence that separates&#160;<br/>Gaza from Israel. For example, between March 2018 and December 2019, Israeli forces killed some&#160;<br/>

<a name=113></a>214 Palestinians, including 46 children, and wounded 36,100 others during Great March of Return&#160;<br/>protests that demanded an end to Israel’s illegal blockade and the right of Palestinian refugees to&#160;<br/>return to their homes.472&#160;While some protesters attempted to approach the fence and damage it, and&#160;<br/>threw stones, Molotov cocktails and incendiary kites in the direction of the fence, Israeli snipers and&#160;<br/>other soldiers shot protesters who were not posing an imminent threat with rubber bullets and live&#160;<br/>ammunition using high-velocity military weapons designed to cause maximum harm (see section 6.3&#160;<br/>“Unlawful killings and serious injuries”).473<br/>
<b>5.4 DISPOSSESSION OF LAND AND PROPERTY &#160;<br/></b>Since 1948 the Israeli state has enforced massive and cruel land seizures to dispossess and exclude&#160;<br/>Palestinians from their land and homes. Although Palestinians in Israel and the OPT are subjected to&#160;<br/>different legal and administrative regimes, Israel has used similar land expropriation measures across all&#160;<br/>territorial domains under the Judaization policy. This seeks to maximize Jewish control over land while&#160;<br/>effectively restricting Palestinians to living in separate, densely populated enclaves. It does not completely&#160;<br/>block Palestinian citizens of Israel from moving to predominantly Jewish localities, as demonstrated by&#160;<br/>the fact that some mainly young Palestinians have done so, at least in recent years, but it has managed to&#160;<br/>minimize their presence there. This policy has been continuously pursued in Israel since 1948 in areas of&#160;<br/>strategic importance that include a significant Palestinian population&#160;such as the Galilee and the Negev/<br/>Naqab, and has been extended to the OPT following Israel’s military occupation in 1967. Today, ongoing&#160;<br/>Israeli efforts to coerce the transfer of Palestinians in the Negev/Naqab, East Jerusalem and Area C of the&#160;<br/>West Bank under discriminatory planning and building regimes are the “new frontiers of dispossession” of&#160;<br/>Palestinians, and the manifestation of the strategy of Judaization and territorial control.474&#160;The land regime&#160;<br/>established soon after Israel’s creation, which was never dismantled, remains a crucial tool in these efforts.&#160;<br/>
This section focuses on the different land and expropriation laws and policies that Israel has continuously&#160;<br/>pursued since 1948 in Israel and as of 1967 also in the OPT to dispossess Palestinians for the sole benefit&#160;<br/>of its Jewish population. They include a selective registration of ownership rights through the land title&#160;<br/>settlement process, a discriminatory allocation of expropriated Palestinian land for Jewish settlement and&#160;<br/>the use of a discriminatory urban planning and zoning regime to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their land&#160;<br/>and properties.<br/>
<b>5.4.1 LAND EXPROPRIATION LAWS AND POLICIES<br/></b>Until 1948, the total land purchased by Jewish individuals and institutions in mandate Palestine amounted&#160;<br/>to about 1.6 million dunams (160,000 hectares), constituting around 6.5% of its total area.475&#160;Palestinians&#160;<br/>owned about 90% of the privately owned land in the territory.476&#160;At that time, Jews comprised around 30%&#160;<br/>of the population and Palestinians around 70%. Within the relatively short period of just over 70 years, a&#160;<br/>deliberate Israeli state policy has reversed this situation, often using brutal means, to ensure Jewish Israeli&#160;<br/>control over resources.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=114></a>While much of the seizure of Palestinian land and property and the destruction of their villages inside Israel&#160;<br/>occurred in the late 1940s and 1950s, massive and racially motivated dispossessions continued into the&#160;<br/>1970s. The effects continue to severely impact Palestinians. They are still excluded from their families’ lands,&#160;<br/>prohibited from accessing and using land and property that belonged to them or their families in 1948,&#160;<br/>discriminated against in access to resources, and effectively restricted to living in enclaves within the state.&#160;<br/>
Indeed, the definition of Israel as the state of the Jewish people and&#160;the commitment to Jewish settlement&#160;<br/>of the land has precluded any possibility of Palestinians enjoying equality in access to land, property and&#160;<br/>resources, with disastrous consequences for their enjoyment of social and economic rights. It has also&#160;<br/>contributed to the isolation and exclusion of Palestinian citizens from Israeli society, marking them as a&#160;<br/>group with perpetual lesser rights and with no right to claim access to lands and properties that have been&#160;<br/>in their families for generations. In this way, it has segregated Palestinian citizens of Israel in a particularly&#160;<br/>cruel manner. This process continues until today, and was most recently reaffirmed by the 2018 nation state&#160;<br/>law (see section 5.1 “Intent to oppress and dominate the Palestinian people”), which reiterated that Israel&#160;<br/>views “the development of Jewish settlement as a national value, and shall act to encourage and promote its&#160;<br/>establishment and strengthening.”477&#160;<br/>
<b>ESTABLISHMENT OF DISCRIMINATORY LAND REGIME &#160;&#160;<br/></b>The massive land appropriation took place through a legal regime designed to effect the transfer of&#160;<br/>lands from Palestinian hands to Jewish Israeli hands, and to keep them in Jewish Israeli hands while&#160;<br/>enabling the Jewish domination and control of these lands to the exclusion of Palestinians.<br/>
Following the 1947-49 conflict and the forced displacement of a&#160;large proportion of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population, Israel proceeded to institute a land regime that aimed to place as much land as possible&#160;<br/>under state control in pursuit of an explicit policy of ensuring Jewish control over land. The Israeli&#160;<br/>land regime consisted of land legislation, reinterpretation of British and Ottoman laws, governmental&#160;<br/>and semi-governmental land institutions, and a supportive judiciary that enabled the acquisition of&#160;<br/>Palestinian land and its discriminatory reallocation.&#160;<br/>
Between 1948 and the early 1950s, Israel instituted a series of emergency regulations and laws&#160;<br/>to seize the land and property belonging to the Palestinian population and to formally transfer the&#160;<br/>ownership of this land to the State of Israel, and from the state to the Jewish National Fund (JNF),&#160;<br/>known in Hebrew as Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL), municipal councils, Jewish localities and Jewish&#160;<br/>individuals and companies.&#160;<br/>
Three main pieces of legislation made up the core of the Israeli land regime and played a major&#160;<br/>role in this process: 1) the Absentees’ Property Law (Transfer of Property Law) of 1950; 2) the Land&#160;<br/>Acquisition Law of 1953; and 3) the British Land (Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance of 1943.&#160;<br/>The laws and their subsequent amendments, which remain in force, were instrumental in expropriating&#160;<br/>and acquiring Palestinian land and property, leading over the years to their exclusive ownership by the&#160;<br/>Israeli state and Jewish national institutions.478&#160;Since East Jerusalem’s annexation in 1967, the entire&#160;<br/>Israeli land regime, with its various laws, land institutions and judicial interpretations, has been utilized&#160;<br/>in East Jerusalem for the expropriation of Palestinian land and its conversion mainly to state land.&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities have also enacted additional legal tools and amendments that affect Palestinian land&#160;<br/>and housing rights in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>
Israel also operates a complex system of land laws to expropriate land, including private Palestinian land,&#160;<br/>and allocate it to the illegal settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank (and, until its unilateral&#160;<br/>withdrawal in 2005, in the Gaza Strip as well).

The main laws which were adopted over the years and apply to the different domains of control are&#160;<br/>discussed below.<br/>
<b>ABSENTEES’ PROPERTY LAW OF 1950 &#160;&#160;<br/></b>In September 1948, following the proclamation of statehood, the Israeli Provisional State Council enacted&#160;<br/>emergency regulations to take over properties of Palestinian refugees and internally displaced persons&#160;<br/>(IDPs). In 1950, the Absentees’ Property Law regulated the question of the property of Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees.480&#160;It effectively gave the state control over all movable and immovable property of all Palestinians&#160;<br/>who were expelled or fled their homes, regardless of whether or&#160;not they became refugees outside the&#160;<br/>country or IDPs in Israel, by defining the latter as “absentee owners”. According to Article 1(b) of the law:<br/>
<i>(b) “absentee” means –</i><br/>
<i>1.&#160;&#160;a person who, at any time during the period between the 16th Kislev, 5708 (29 November&#160;</i><br/>
<i>1947) and the day on which a declaration is published, under section 9(d) of the Law&#160;<br/>and Administration Ordinance, 5708-1948, that the state of emergency declared by the&#160;<br/>Provisional Council of State on the 10th Iyar, 5708 (19 May 1948) has ceased to exist, was&#160;<br/>a legal owner of any property situated in the area of Israel or enjoyed or held it, whether by&#160;<br/>himself or through another, and who, at any time during the said period –&#160;</i><br/>
<i>i.&#160;&#160;was a national or citizen of the Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Trans-Jordan, Iraq&#160;</i><br/>

Hence, all Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes after 29 November 1947, and&#160;<br/>Arab nationals of the Arab states mentioned in the article, became “absentees” and their movable and&#160;<br/>immovable properties became eligible for confiscation and possession by the Custodian of Absentee&#160;<br/>Property, the head of an entity appointed by the Israeli minister of finance that manages absentees’&#160;<br/>property.482&#160;Their status as “absentees” still applies because the “state of emergency” in Israel, which&#160;<br/>was declared on 19 May 1948, remains in force.483<br/>
Under this law, Israel appropriated between 4.2 and 6.6 million dunams (420,000 to 666,000&#160;<br/>hectares) of land.484&#160;According to Michael Fischbach, who relied on the records of the UN Conciliation&#160;<br/>Commission for Palestine (UNCCP), Israel took over 4.45 million dunams of land in private ownership&#160;<br/>

In order to prevent the return of Palestinians and to use the available land, Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>demolished the vast majority of the nearly 500 Palestinian villages deserted during the 1947-49 conflict&#160;<br/>and enabled the Custodian of Absentee Property to transfer Palestinian properties to third parties. In&#160;<br/>the same year, Israel enacted the 1950 Development Authority Law (Properties Transfer),488&#160;which&#160;<br/>founded the Development Authority, a body established to administer the property of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees and other property confiscated by the state (under the&#160;1953 Land Acquisition Law – see&#160;<br/>below) for the benefit of the state.<br/>
The Development Authority was responsible for “developing” the State of Israel through the use of&#160;<br/>Palestinian property. It settled immigrant Jewish families in Palestinian refugees’ houses and made&#160;<br/>land available to state authorities for the development of new Jewish localities. The 1950 Development&#160;<br/>Authority Law authorized the Development Authority to own, sell, lease, build and renovate property,&#160;<br/>and conduct property transactions only with the state, the JNF/KKL or a body that was authorized for&#160;<br/>this purpose by the state, such as municipal authorities.489&#160;<br/>
Another major transfer of Palestinian refugees’ land was from the Israeli government to the JNF/KKL,&#160;<br/>known as the “two million deal”. The first million dunams (more&#160;precisely 1,109,769 dunams) were&#160;<br/>transferred in January 1949, a month after the passage of UN Resolution 194 on the right of return for&#160;<br/>Palestinian refugees. The second million dunams (more precisely 1,271,734 dunams) were transferred&#160;<br/>in October 1950.490&#160;The JNF/KKL worked with the Israeli government to make these lands available&#160;<br/>for Jewish settlement and forestation. Thus, the land of the Palestinian “absentees” was transferred to&#160;<br/>various Jewish institutions, governmental bodies and municipal councils, and then leased to individual&#160;<br/>Jewish Israelis who either lived in the houses or apartments of Palestinians, or leased the land for&#160;<br/>industrial or agricultural purposes. By 1950, the JNF/KKL owned 2.1 million dunams and the state&#160;<br/>claimed ownership of 16.7 million dunams of land.491<br/>
The Absentees’ Property Law included in its definition Palestinian IDPs, numbering about 30,000&#160;<br/>people in 1948. These people had been internally displaced from their villages and homes and had&#160;<br/>settled mostly in nearby Palestinian villages inside Israel. They were deemed “absentees” even though&#160;<br/>they never crossed an international border and, in many cases, remained within a few kilometres&#160;<br/>of their homes and land. (For example, Palestinians from Saffuryi settled in Nazareth, Palestinians&#160;<br/>from Ma’lul settled in Yafat Al-Nasira, and Palestinians from Iqrit settled in Al-Jish.) These IDPs&#160;<br/>became known as the “present absentees”. In 1973, the Knesset passed legislation to compensate&#160;<br/>the “present absentees”, but not to allow their return to their lands or villages, even if their lands&#160;<br/>were still empty and not possessed by a third party.492&#160;However, few Palestinians applied to receive&#160;<br/>compensation, refusing to surrender their historical claim to the land, forcing the Knesset to extend the&#160;<br/>three-year period to claim compensation.493<br/>

<a name=117></a><b>JUDAIZATION OF GALILEE: DESTRUCTION OF IQRIT &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
In 1948, the Israeli army instructed the nearly 600 residents of Iqrit,494&#160;a Palestinian village north-east of&#160;<br/>Acre in northern Israel, to leave their residences “temporarily”. The village was declared a military zone&#160;<br/>under the Defence (Emergency) Regulations, and they were never allowed to return.495&#160;The residents&#160;<br/>petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel to be granted their right of return to their lands, and won the&#160;<br/>case. The Israeli Ministry of Defense refused to implement the decision. Instead, it issued a new military&#160;<br/>order and destroyed the village in 1951 except for the church and cemetery, which remain intact until&#160;<br/>today. These actions were taken to ensure that Iqrit did not create a precedent for the return of other&#160;<br/>Palestinians to their villages.496&#160;The former residents of Iqrit appealed to the Supreme Court several&#160;<br/>times and lobbied politically for their return. Their last petition was in 2003 when they asked to return to&#160;<br/>their original homes or at least to nearby areas unused by the state.497&#160;The court rejected their petition to&#160;<br/>return to their original lands, based on the state’s claim that the security situation could not justify their&#160;<br/>return, and instead offered them compensation.498&#160;The government again expressed its concern that&#160;<br/>accepting the petition would have far-reaching implications for other internally displaced citizens, who&#160;<br/>would also demand to return to their original villages.499&#160;<br/>
The community of Iqrit now comprises around 1,500 individuals, many of whom live in the village of&#160;<br/>Al-Rameh 20km away. Despite Israel’s refusal to grant them their right to return to their original village,&#160;<br/>the community has, since the 1970s, held religious and social events at the church there. Shadia&#160;<br/>Murqos Sbeit, an Iqrit community activist who has been involved in organizing for the return to Iqrit, told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International: “The cemetery and the church play a crucial role, because marriage and death&#160;<br/>ceremonies take place in the village, keeping the cycle of life alive.”500<br/>
Shadia Murqos Sbeit has been involved in the struggle to return to Iqrit since the 1990s when, along&#160;<br/>with other young members of the community, she started setting up camps in the village as a way to&#160;<br/>return. She said:&#160;<br/>
<i>We launched the “return camps” as another form of struggle [against our displacement]. We&#160;<br/>wanted a struggle that was different, one which did not care about the government or the court&#160;<br/>and which made the return and the belonging to the village as central to the struggle, so we&#160;<br/>moved to live in the village. We wanted to fight for our community and not only lands. This struggle&#160;<br/>continues until today.</i><br/>
The community’s campaign to return to the village continues despite Israel’s continual denial and&#160;<br/>actions to stop it. Shadia Murqos Sbeit added:<br/>
<i>Our children are now part of the struggle. But [Israeli] authorities continually try to prevent them&#160;<br/>from setting up anything outside the church grounds. Some activists are targeted by the police&#160;<br/>and some were given orders to stay away from the village. The authorities would confiscate&#160;<br/>anything they find outside the church and have uprooted what the activists planted. One time the&#160;<br/>authorities handed down an order to remove a donkey they had brought and another for a chicken&#160;<br/>pen [they had] set up. Despite all of this, people continue the struggle to return.</i><br/>

The case of IDPs from the village of Iqrit is a prime example of Israel’s use of military rule to dispossess&#160;<br/>Palestinians and prevent them from returning to their homes and&#160;villages – undermining the official&#160;<br/>narrative at the time that military rule was necessary to maintain security – while simultaneously&#160;<br/>allowing the state to confiscate Palestinian property under the&#160;Absentees’ Property Law.<br/>
The Absentees’ Property Law also deemed as “abandoned”&#160;<i>waqf</i>&#160;property in Israel,&#160;<i>waqf</i>&#160;being an&#160;<br/>endowment under Islamic law by which an institution holds property for charitable purposes, often as the&#160;<br/>result of a donation by an individual or group. This included Muslim holy sites, houses, trade centres and&#160;<br/>other buildings, businesses and farm lands. These were then appropriated by the state and transferred&#160;<br/>to the Custodian of Absentee Property.501&#160;As much as 85% of waqf properties were transferred to&#160;<br/>the Custodian of Absentee Property.502&#160;Until 1948, the Supreme Muslim Council had administered&#160;<br/><i>waqf</i>&#160;properties. Israel considered the council as an “absentee” since most of its members became&#160;<br/>refugees. While there are no specific statistics on the confiscated&#160;<i>waqf</i>&#160;properties, such properties had&#160;<br/>been substantial and a well-established tradition in Palestine since the Ottoman era. According to one&#160;<br/>academic study, up to 20% of the cultivated lands in Palestine constituted waqf land in 1948.503<br/>
Challenges to this mass appropriation of&#160;<i>waqf</i>&#160;properties reached the Israeli courts. Due to the&#160;<br/>sensitivity and complexity of the matter, including the fact that some of the&#160;<i>waqf</i>&#160;properties were also&#160;<br/>registered under the name of the trustees (persons or committees) and that some were religious&#160;<br/>sites, the Custodian of Absentee Property released the administration of some waqf sites to the Israeli&#160;<br/>

<a name=119></a>Ministry of Religious Affairs. However, to circumvent this decision, in 1965 the Knesset passed a legal&#160;<br/>amendment that retroactively authorized the transfer of&#160;<i>waqf</i>&#160;ownership directly to the Custodian of&#160;<br/>Absentee Property free of any claims or conditions that were put in place when it was endowed.504&#160;<br/>
Following Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities gradually applied the Absentees’&#160;<br/>Property Law to further the dispossession of Palestinian land and refugee property in the city. In 1968,&#160;<br/>the Israeli State Attorney issued a guideline to the Israeli&#160;authorities in charge not to confiscate the&#160;<br/>properties of Palestinians who remained in the rest of the West Bank, but allowed the confiscation of&#160;<br/>properties of Palestinians and other Arabs who ended up as refugees outside the OPT.505&#160;Two years&#160;<br/>later, Israel passed the Legal and Administrative Matters Law, which regulated the application of Israeli&#160;<br/>laws in annexed East Jerusalem, including the application of the Absentees’ Property Law.506&#160;Until&#160;<br/>1977, there was limited application of the law in Jerusalem. However, when the Likud Party came to&#160;<br/>power that year, the government of prime minister Menachem Begin changed this policy. It passed a&#160;<br/>decision in December 1977 that allowed for the confiscation of all “absentees’ properties”, including of&#160;<br/>those Palestinians who were still in the OPT.&#160;<br/>
Israel’s decision to move the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem to encompass East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>impacted the lives of Palestinians living in the West Bank who had property or parts of property in the&#160;<br/>newly annexed area. The Israeli authorities designated these as “absentees’ properties” and as such&#160;<br/>subject to confiscation by Israel, even though in some cases they were located only a few metres from&#160;<br/>the Palestinian owners’ homes.<br/>
It was not until 1992 that the application of the law drew public attention following the founding of&#160;<br/>an inter-ministerial commission to investigate the state’s role, including the use of state funds, in&#160;<br/>confiscating properties in East Jerusalem and passing them to private individuals and Jewish settler&#160;<br/>organizations, mainly Ateret Cohanim (formally known as Ateret Yerushalayim) and Elad-Ir David&#160;<br/>Foundation (Elad).507&#160;Both organizations play a central role in the process of ensuring Jewish control&#160;<br/>in East Jerusalem, mainly by seeking to settle Jews in the Old City and in Palestinian neighbourhoods&#160;<br/>(see section 5.4.3 “Discriminatory allocation of expropriated Palestinian land for Jewish settlement”).&#160;<br/>The inter-ministerial commission looked into 68 such properties, a significant proportion of which were&#160;<br/>confiscated as “absentees’ properties”.508&#160;<br/>
Despite the Israeli Supreme Court’s approval of the legality of the application of the Absentees’ Property&#160;<br/>Law in the 1980s and 1990s,509&#160;in 2005 then Israeli attorney general Menachem Mazuz said that&#160;<br/>the “absence” of Palestinians who lived in the West Bank and owned property in East Jerusalem was&#160;<br/>

<a name=120></a>merely “technical” and that there were several legal difficulties arising from the application of the law to&#160;<br/>such cases.510&#160;The authorities therefore decided that there should be a special commission under the&#160;<br/>law to approve the confiscation or the release of “absentees’ properties” in East Jerusalem.511&#160;However,&#160;<br/>this position was changed in 2010 when a subsequent attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, concluded&#160;<br/>that the law should be applied as before. In April 2015, the Israeli Supreme Court reaffirmed the&#160;<br/>applicability of the Absentees’ Property Law to properties in East Jerusalem owned by Palestinians&#160;<br/>living in the West Bank, and approved all preceding expropriations carried out under the law.512&#160;As a&#160;<br/>result, the Absentees’ Property Law continues to be used to&#160;confiscate properties in East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>whose owners are in the West Bank, despite political criticism.513&#160;It also continues to be used as a tool&#160;<br/>by settler organizations to increase Jewish presence in East Jerusalem.514&#160;<br/>
The application of the Absentees’ Property Law in East Jerusalem on Palestinian property but not&#160;<br/>on Jewish property demonstrates a discriminatory policy.515&#160;This conclusion is reinforced by the far&#160;<br/>more favourable way in which the Israeli authorities have dealt with property previously belonging to&#160;<br/>Jewish owners in East Jerusalem. In 1973, the Knesset passed an amendment to the 1970 Legal and&#160;<br/>Administrative Matters Law to address the question of pre-1948 Jewish properties in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>Under the amendment, the law transferred all pre-1948 Jewish properties in annexed East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>held by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property to the Israeli Custodian General, the head of an&#160;<br/>entity under the authority of the Israeli Ministry of Justice that manages all property in Israel when the&#160;<br/>owners cannot manage it or are untraceable, but also plays a significant role regarding properties in&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem owned by Israelis before 1948.516&#160;Further, the law stated that, upon the request of the&#160;<br/>original Jewish owner or their lawful heirs, the Custodian General will release such properties back&#160;<br/>to them.517&#160;The law applies only to Jewish property owners, not to Palestinians whose properties, for&#160;<br/>example in West Jerusalem, were confiscated after 1948. It is a clearly discriminatory compensation&#160;<br/>scheme that only benefits Jewish property owners. It should also&#160;be noted that the original Jewish&#160;<br/>owners, mainly Jews displaced in the wake of the 1947-49&#160;conflict, received alternative housing from&#160;<br/>the State of Israel after 1948.518&#160;&#160;<br/>
According to one estimate considering Israel and East Jerusalem together, the Israeli authorities have&#160;<br/>expropriated over 10,000 shops, 25,000 buildings and almost 60% of the fertile land belonging to&#160;<br/>Palestinian refugees under the Absentees’ Property Law.519<br/>

120<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a>owned by Palestinian citizens of Israel who were not affected by the Absentees’ Property Law. The&#160;<br/>authorities looked for other means to confiscate these lands&#160;and transfer ownership to the state. To that&#160;<br/>end, the 1953 Land Acquisition Law retroactively “legalized” expropriation of lands that the state, newly&#160;<br/>established Jewish localities and the Israeli army had taken control of using emergency regulations&#160;<br/>after the 1947-49 conflict. The law also laid the legal basis for further land expropriation.&#160;<br/>
The Israeli authorities had initially used the British-enacted 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations to&#160;<br/>declare certain areas as “closed zones” to prevent Palestinians from returning to their lands there or&#160;<br/>from farming them.520&#160;Together with the restrictions of the military administration over the movement&#160;<br/>of Palestinian citizens of Israel, these were an essential component of ensuring Jewish control over&#160;<br/>land (see section 5.3.4 “Use of military rule”). The Israeli-enacted Emergency Regulations (Security&#160;<br/>Zones) of 1949 then authorized the defence minister to declare security zones and order people to&#160;<br/>leave such areas. For example, the eviction of Palestinians from the villages of Iqrit and Biraim was&#160;<br/>conducted&#160;under these regulations.521&#160;The Emergency Regulations (Cultivation of Waste Lands and Use&#160;<br/>of Unexploited Water Resources) of 1948 authorized the minister of agriculture to take over uncultivated&#160;<br/>lands.522&#160;The 1949 Emergency Land Requisition (Regulation) Law permitted the “requisition” of land or&#160;<br/>buildings “for the defence of the state, public security, the maintenance of essential supplies or essential&#160;<br/>public services, the absorption of immigrants of the rehabilitation of ex-soldiers or war invalids.”523&#160;<br/>
The land and property taken over under these emergency regulations were controlled and used by&#160;<br/>Jewish localities and institutions. However, the original Palestinian owners still held legal title to the&#160;<br/>land. Consequently, the Knesset passed the 1953 Land Acquisition Law that allowed the land to be&#160;<br/>confiscated and the legal title of the Palestinian owners to be&#160;terminated. Under this law, land could be&#160;<br/>registered as state land if:&#160;<br/>
<i>1.&#160;&#160;it was not in possession of a third party on the 1st of April 1952;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>2.&#160;&#160;it was used or allocated by the state between 14 May 1948, and 1 April 1952, for&#160;</i><br/>
<i>development, settlement or security purposes; and&#160;</i><br/>
<i>3.&#160;&#160;it was still required for any of these purposes.</i><br/>
With a certificate issued by the minister of finance that these&#160;conditions applied, the land would be&#160;<br/>transferred to the Development Authority. Some 1.25 million dunams were expropriated in Israel under&#160;<br/>the Land Acquisition Law, 137,400 dunams of which were expropriated from Bedouins in the Negev/<br/>Naqab.524&#160;A small amount of compensation was proposed under this law, but few Palestinians applied&#160;<br/>for it. By 2000, Palestinians had filed only 15,975 compensation claims for 205,669 dunams that had&#160;<br/>been confiscated under both the Land Acquisition Law and the Absentees’ Property Law.525&#160;The main&#160;<br/>reason for the low number of applicants was Palestinians’ refusal to legitimize the Israeli confiscation of&#160;<br/>their lands. Further, the offered compensation was much lower than the real value of the land.526<br/>

<a name=122></a>(Acquisition for Public Purposes) Ordinance of 1943. Under the&#160;ordinance, the minister of finance was&#160;<br/>given broad powers to expropriate land for “public purposes”, which are any purposes defined as such&#160;<br/>by the minister. The minister is not required to provide details of the purpose and, upon the payment of&#160;<br/>compensation, the state takes permanent ownership or temporary use of the land.527&#160;<br/>
The ordinance laid the groundwork for confiscation of lands that&#160;still remained in the hands of&#160;<br/>Palestinians, allowing confiscation for a range of public purposes beyond those provided in other laws&#160;<br/>and regulations. Confiscation for “public purposes” has been abused to transfer land from Palestinians&#160;<br/>to the state and for the exclusive benefit of Jewish Israelis&#160;and institutions.<br/>
The major use of the ordinance began in the mid-1950s as part of the government’s plans for&#160;<br/>“Judaizing the Galilee”.528&#160;Major Jewish Israeli cities and towns (such as Upper Nazareth, Ma’alot&#160;<br/>and Karmiel) were planned to be built in the midst of predominantly Palestinian areas in the Galilee to&#160;<br/>obstruct any Palestinian geographic contiguity there.529<br/>
From the late 1950s, Israel used the ordinance to expropriate massive areas of privately owned&#160;<br/>Palestinian land and transfer it for the building and development of Jewish cities, towns and&#160;<br/>settlements by allocating it to the JNF/KKL. For example, in 1957 the Israeli authorities used the&#160;<br/>legislation to expropriate 1,200 dunams from Palestinian landowners in Nazareth and surrounding&#160;<br/>villages to be used to establish the Jewish town of Upper Nazareth.530&#160;The law was also used to&#160;<br/>expropriate over 20,000 dunams of land surrounding Palestinian villages in the Galilee, triggering&#160;<br/>protests in which six Palestinian protesters were killed and more than 100 were injured by Israeli&#160;<br/>forces on 30 March 1976.531&#160;Palestinians in Israel and the OPT commemorate the event each year&#160;<br/>as Land Day.<br/>
Under the ordinance, Israel expropriated at least 1.2 to 1.3 million dunams of land from the&#160;<br/>Palestinian population in Israel.532&#160;According to one academic study, a 1992 report of the Israel&#160;<br/>Land Administration, the Israeli government body then responsible for managing state land in Israel,&#160;<br/>indicates that the ordinance was invoked in the confiscation of&#160;1.85 million dunams, 92% of which&#160;<br/>were privately owned by Palestinians.533<br/>
In 2001, for the first time, the Israeli Supreme Court&#160;challenged, in a landmark precedent, the law&#160;<br/>of land expropriation in Israel when examining the confiscation,&#160;under the 1943 ordinance, of land&#160;<br/>previously owned by Jewish Israeli owners. The&#160;<i>Karsik</i>&#160;case was brought by the heirs of the original&#160;<br/>Jewish owner. The precedent, delivered by a nine-judge bench each with different reasoning, ruled that&#160;<br/>if the public purpose that served as the basis for the land expropriation ceased to exist, as a rule the&#160;<br/>expropriation is to be cancelled, and the original owner is entitled to the return of the land subject to&#160;<br/>exceptions and rules that are to be formulated.534&#160;Following the decision, and fearing the large impact&#160;<br/>this might have regarding land confiscated from Palestinian owners, the Knesset passed legislation to&#160;<br/>circumvent the&#160;<i>Karsik</i>&#160;decision. The 2010 amendment to the Land (Acquisition for Public Purposes)&#160;<br/>Ordinance of 1943 affirmed the legality of Israel’s ownership of&#160;the land expropriated under this law,&#160;<br/>

<a name=123></a>even when the land was not used for the original purpose of the expropriation.535&#160;The amendment also&#160;<br/>authorized the minister of finance to sell the expropriated&#160;land to third parties, such as Jewish national&#160;<br/>institutions.536&#160;Adalah has documented that the aim of the amendment was primarily to block claims&#160;<br/>from Palestinian landowners to land confiscated from them for “public purposes” and which later was&#160;<br/>not used for that purpose.537&#160;<br/>
<b>MILITARY ORDERS IN OPT &#160;&#160;<br/></b>As mentioned above, Israel resorted to emergency and military&#160;legislation to confiscate Palestinian&#160;<br/>land in the West Bank beyond East Jerusalem and, until its unilateral withdrawal in 2005, in the&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip as well, in order to establish and maintain its control over the territory by building and&#160;<br/>expanding settlements and their related infrastructure, setting up national parks, archaeological sites&#160;<br/>and military “firing zones”. In the first decade of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities proceeded to confiscate privately owned&#160;Palestinian land mainly through requisition&#160;<br/>(or land seizure) orders, in addition to expropriation orders, absentee property orders and military&#160;<br/>orders declaring specific areas as “closed military zones”.538&#160;These measures were legitimized by the&#160;<br/>Supreme Court of Israel, which ultimately rendered the question of the legality of the settlements non-<br/>justiciable.539&#160;The court held that the expropriation of private land to establish civilian settlements was&#160;<br/>legal as long as the expropriation was necessary for security reasons and temporary.540<br/>
Under requisition orders, Palestinian private owners were forced to “lease” their land to the Israeli&#160;<br/>state to build military bases and Jewish settlements, which the Israeli authorities claimed were needed&#160;<br/>for security reasons. While the orders were issued for limited periods, and as such were deemed&#160;<br/>temporary, the fact that they were renewable, on the one hand, and that they often failed to include an&#160;<br/>expiry date, on the other, meant that the requisition was in fact permanent. By contrast, expropriation&#160;<br/>orders forcibly transferred Palestinian private ownership rights to the state permanently. Given the&#160;<br/>permanent nature of the procedure, expropriation under military orders is authorized only if carried&#160;<br/>out for “public purposes” to serve the “local” population through infrastructure such as roads and&#160;<br/>public buildings. However, much of Palestinian land in the OPT was expropriated for the&#160;sole benefit&#160;<br/>of settlers to build settler-only bypass roads. Tens of thousands of dunams were also expropriated for&#160;<br/>the construction of Ma’ale Adumim and Ofra settlements near Jerusalem and Ramallah, respectively,&#160;<br/>under the guise of constructing an industrial zone and “workers’ accommodations” in these areas.541&#160;<br/>In addition, vast parts of the OPT were declared as “closed military zones” under military orders, which&#160;<br/>prevented any Palestinians, including their legal owners, from accessing them without a special permit.&#160;<br/>Such areas include parts of the Jordan Valley and the South Hebron Hills, which are used primarily for&#160;<br/>military training, as well as land around settlements.542&#160;<br/>

<a name=124></a>Mirroring the provisions included in the 1950 Absentees’ Property Law, which the Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>used to confiscate land and property belonging to Palestinian refugees and IDPs from the 1947-49&#160;<br/>conflict, military orders and regulations concerning absentee property became another tool for the&#160;<br/>authorities to seize land and property left behind by Palestinian refugees who fled the West Bank&#160;<br/>and Gaza Strip during the 1967 conflict and have in most cases been barred from returning to their&#160;<br/>homes. Under Military Order 58 of 1967, “property whose legal owner, or whoever is granted the&#160;<br/>power to control it by law, left the area prior to 7 June 1967 or subsequently” is declared “absentee” or&#160;<br/>“abandoned” property. The order and its subsequent amendments transferred the administration of all&#160;<br/>“absentee” land and property to the Custodian of Absentee Property (and later on to the Custodian for&#160;<br/>Government and Abandoned Property in Judea and Samaria, the head of an entity under the authority&#160;<br/>of the Israeli Civil Administration charged with managing land and property in the occupied West Bank&#160;<br/>excluding East Jerusalem) until the return of its legal owners, who are allowed to claim it back. In&#160;<br/>practice however, in the rare cases where Palestinian owners were able to either prove that they were&#160;<br/>not absentees or return to the OPT under family unification procedures, they were for the most part&#160;<br/>unable to retrieve their land and businesses on the basis that any transaction relating to their transfer,&#160;<br/>and which was authorized by the Custodian of Absentee Property, was done in “good faith”.543&#160;Indeed,&#160;<br/>thousands of dunams of absentee land in the Jordan Valley were allocated for settlement construction&#160;<br/>and the establishment of military bases. In 2006, Israeli officials admitted that owners of absentee&#160;<br/>land had been placed on a special list to prevent their return to the OPT and bar them from claiming&#160;<br/>their property.544<br/>
In 1979, a Supreme Court decision regarding the Elon Moreh settlement near Nablus forced the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities to change their policy of requisitioning land for military purposes. The court ruled that the&#160;<br/>settlement was illegal because its purpose was not military after hearing arguments by both settlers&#160;<br/>and the serving army chief of staff at the time challenging the state’s position of military necessity,&#160;<br/>which they advanced for ideological and strategic reasons. Since then, the use of requisition orders has&#160;<br/>dropped drastically but has not stopped altogether, while land requisitioned until then has never been&#160;<br/>returned to its Palestinian owners.&#160;<br/>
Following the court decision, the Israeli authorities started&#160;confiscating large parts of land unregistered&#160;<br/>in the Land Registry by declaring them state land based on Military Order 59 of 1967 Concerning State&#160;<br/>Property.545&#160;Under the order, “state property” is defined as any property that belonged to&#160;a “hostile&#160;<br/>state” before 7 June 1967, “or any property belonging to an arbitration body connected to a hostile&#160;<br/>state”. This includes land that was unregistered, or land whose ownership was in the process of being&#160;<br/>determined by the courts (see section 5.4.2 “Land title settlement: registration of land rights”) as well&#160;<br/>as both movable and immovable property. The order placed all such property under the authority of&#160;<br/>the Custodian for Government and Abandoned Property in Judea and Samaria and empowered them&#160;<br/>to enter into transactions related to that property which, even if that property was shown subsequently&#160;<br/>not to belong to the state, would still stand provided that they were done in “good faith”. As in the case&#160;<br/>of “absentee property”, the “good faith” provision prevented the overwhelming majority of Palestinian&#160;<br/>owners from retrieving their land even when they had legal claims.546<br/>
<b>5.4.2 LAND TITLE SETTLEMENT: REGISTRATION OF LAND RIGHTS<br/></b>The land title settlement process, which was initiated in 1928 under the British mandate, became an&#160;<br/>additional tool for Israel’s dispossession of Palestinians across all domains of control and, ultimately,&#160;<br/>

<a name=125></a>enabled the Israeli authorities to transfer millions of dunams of state land for Jewish settlement.547&#160;On the&#160;<br/>basis of their Land (Settlement of Title) Ordinance of 1928, the British authorities aimed to register land&#160;<br/>titles based on surveyed maps that divided land into identified blocs&#160;and parcels.548&#160;However, by the end&#160;<br/>of their mandate, they had only registered the title of some 5.5 million of Palestine’s 26 million dunams, 5&#160;<br/>million of which fell within what became Israel.549&#160;The British began the process selectively, mostly in Jewish&#160;<br/>areas or in areas where land disputes between Jews and Arabs existed.550&#160;The British ordinance, with a few&#160;<br/>amendments, was incorporated into the Israeli legal system and became known as the Land (Settlement of&#160;<br/>Title) Ordinance (New Version) or Land Law in 1969.551&#160;Through the legal reinterpretation of Ottoman and&#160;<br/>British law and, in the case of the OPT, Jordanian law, changes in the evidentiary rules, together with minor&#160;<br/>legal amendments, the Israeli government was able to exploit the unfinished land rights registration process&#160;<br/>to appropriate further Palestinian lands across all territorial domains and declare them to be state land.552<br/>
After 1948, Israel continued the land registration process, starting in the Galilee, where thousands of land&#160;<br/>disputes emerged in the second half of the 1950s as a result, and in deserted Palestinian villages and&#160;<br/>neighbourhoods in West Jerusalem (Lifta, Ein Karem and Qatamon). The purpose of this process was to&#160;<br/>transfer Palestinian refugee land and state land for Jewish settlement. First, the Knesset amended the&#160;<br/>rules of adverse possession, the process by which a land’s possessor was able to gain a title to it following&#160;<br/>a particular period of time.553&#160;Adverse possession was central to Ottoman land law and to Palestine’s land&#160;<br/>regime given the general lack of formal title registration until 1948. Under the Ottoman Land Code, to gain&#160;<br/>a title by adverse possession, claimants were required to show that they had possessed and cultivated the&#160;<br/>land for 10 years without dispute.554&#160;The Knesset extended the period required for a claimant to gain a title&#160;<br/>by adverse possession more than once and finally stated that the mere declaration of the settlement process&#160;<br/>over particular areas would freeze time for the purpose of making a claim by adverse possession, thereby&#160;<br/>preventing Palestinians from gaining titles to lands they had possessed before the founding of Israel.555&#160;&#160;<br/>
At the same time, the Israeli judiciary developed restrictions on the type and admissibility of evidence&#160;<br/>required to prove adverse possession. Whereas the actual possession of land was deemed central to prove&#160;<br/>rights during the British mandate, its significance declined dramatically during the 1950s.556&#160;The judiciary&#160;<br/>

<a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/review/data/eng/law/kns0_govt-justice_eng.pdf">law/kns0_govt-justice_eng.pdf&#160;This ordinance was adopted to maintain legal continuity after the establishment of the State of Israel on 14&#160;</a><br/>
May 1948. It provides for all existing laws to remain in force, subject to legal modifications&#160;resulting from either the state’s establishment or&#160;<br/>
subsequent legislation.<br/>
553.&#160;Under the Ottoman Land Code, possession of land was allocated directly by the government through a title deed (<i>kushan</i>), which&#160;<br/>
was proof of the individual’s right to use the land, but not of actual ownership. The Ottomans had a clear interest in guaranteeing the&#160;<br/>
cultivation of the land, which was reflected in Article 78 of the Land Code: “Everyone who has possessed and cultivated&#160;<i>miri</i>&#160;[state&#160;<br/>
agricultural land]… land for ten years without dispute acquires&#160;a right by prescription and whether he has a valid title deed&#160;or not, the&#160;<br/>
land cannot be regarded as abandoned, and he shall be given a new title deed free of charge.” The British Mandate Government treated&#160;<br/>
the title deed (kushan) as a proof of full ownership of the land. See NRC,&#160;<i>A Guide to Housing, Land and Property Law in Area C of the&#160;</i><br/>

<a name=126></a>imposed rules that required a higher standard of proof for demonstrating that land was cultivated, setting&#160;<br/>a new condition that 50% of land had to be under cultivation and using mandate-era aerial photos taken&#160;<br/>in 1945 by the British as proof of lack of cultivation.557&#160;It also rejected tax payment records as evidence&#160;<br/>of cultivation or to prove rights in land settlement processes.558&#160;These judicial rules and precedents were&#160;<br/>applied in the Galilee in the 1950s and 1960s, and then applied both in the Negev/Naqab and, after 1967,&#160;<br/>in the West Bank (see below).559&#160;As pointed out in 1957 by Yosef Weitz, a pivotal JNF/KKL official who&#160;<br/>became the first director of the Israel Land Administration: “The aim&#160;of work until now has been to secure&#160;<br/>state ownership of its lands. The aim now is Yihud ha-Galil [Judaization of the Galilee]…”560<br/>
Similarly, the head of the Ministry of Justice’s Registration and Settlement Department stated in 1959 that&#160;<br/>“[t]he work today is not done for settlement of title purposes only... but especially for clarifying the prospects&#160;<br/>of [Jewish] settlement in areas that are mainly inhabited by Arabs, mostly on land claimed by the State.”561&#160;&#160;<br/>Many land disputes between the state and Palestinian landholders reached the Israeli courts. However, in&#160;<br/>85% of the cases, the courts ruled in favour of the Israel Land Administration.562<br/>
In 1951, the Knesset passed the State Property Law, which transferred ownership of all properties of the British&#160;<br/>Mandate Government of Palestine to the State of Israel (Article 2), as well as ownership of properties with no owners&#160;<br/>(Article 3). The mandate government claimed ownership of over 1 million dunams, so these were transferred&#160;<br/>to the State of Israel.563&#160;Under the process of land title settlement, the Israeli government also transferred close&#160;<br/>to 10 million dunams of land considered as wasteland so that it&#160;was classified as state land. Hence, the Israeli&#160;<br/>government claimed large tracts of both wasteland and cultivated land. In the Negev/Naqab, the land title&#160;<br/>registration process was more complex and remains disputed until today, as the Israeli government deems the land&#160;<br/>cultivated by the Bedouin as&#160;<i>mewat</i>&#160;(dead or waste) land,564&#160;despite their cultivation by Bedouin communities.565&#160;<br/>
In parallel, following the 1947-49 conflict, the Jordanian authorities continued the British-initiated land&#160;<br/>registration process in the West Bank, mainly in the Nablus and Ramallah sub-districts and in the Jordan&#160;<br/>Valley. By 1967, only about 30% of the West Bank was registered under the land title settlement procedure,&#160;<br/>including 12% registered as state land.566&#160;In East Jerusalem, Jordan registered only a few land blocs; 90% of&#160;<br/>the land remained unregistered at the time of annexation.567&#160;The Israeli land authorities failed to register any&#160;<br/>of the land transactions in these registered blocs.568&#160;In 1968, Israel suspended the land settlement process&#160;<br/>in the OPT, including in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>

<a name=127></a>As a result, individuals living in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) who wished to register previously&#160;<br/>unregistered land had to do it privately under a procedure known as&#160;“first registration”. However, the&#160;<br/>large amount of evidence required to prove both possession and continuous cultivation of land, the high&#160;<br/>costs involved and the length of the procedure meant that it was inaccessible for most Palestinians. The&#160;<br/>procedure therefore mostly benefited Israeli settlers and companies&#160;who wanted to register the ownership&#160;<br/>of land that they had bought, or claimed to have bought, in the West Bank.569&#160;Amongst such companies are&#160;<br/>subsidiaries of the JNF/KKL whose presence and activities were facilitated through Israeli military orders and&#160;<br/>amendments to Jordanian laws (see section 5.4.3 “Discriminatory allocation of expropriated land for Jewish&#160;<br/>settlement”).570<br/>
Over the years, the Israeli authorities were able to exploit the suspension of the land settlement process&#160;<br/>and non-registration of individual property rights to gain control over large parts of Palestinian land in the&#160;<br/>OPT, including in East Jerusalem, for the sole benefit of its Jewish population. As stated above, following the&#160;<br/>1979 Supreme Court ruling on the Elon Moreh settlement (see section 5.4.1 “Land expropriation laws and&#160;<br/>policies”) the Israeli authorities largely stopped the requisition of private land in the OPT for the construction&#160;<br/>of settlements. Instead, they proceeded to declare hundreds of thousands of dunams of unregistered and&#160;<br/>uncultivated land as state land through a simple procedure defined&#160;under the Civil Administration’s internal&#160;<br/>rules, which did not seek to establish individual property rights.571<br/>
To declare land as state land, the Custodian for Government and Abandoned Property in Judea and Samaria&#160;<br/>merely had to claim ownership of a specific area before making it public&#160;by signing a document specifying&#160;<br/>its exact location and total area, and delivering it to the&#160;<i>mukhtar</i>&#160;(representative) of the concerned village.&#160;<br/>Declarations of state land were in most cases not registered in the Land Registry but kept in a separate&#160;<br/>registration system administered by the Custodian for Government and Abandoned Property in Judea and&#160;<br/>Samaria. Even though anyone was entitled to submit an objection to a state land declaration within 45 days&#160;<br/>of its issuance, in practice, such objections were submitted only in rare cases due to the high costs and&#160;<br/>high threshold of evidence required. Further, when examining such cases, the Military Appeals Committees&#160;<br/>applied the same higher standard of proof for demonstrating cultivation of land as in the case of the&#160;<br/>dispossession of Palestinian land in Israel in the 1950s.572&#160;Indeed, the Israeli authorities applied the same&#160;<br/>interpretation of Ottoman laws as they did inside Israel in order to redefine land registration requirements to&#160;<br/>confiscate Palestinian lands for the benefit of Jewish Israelis.<br/>
As a result, despite the Elon Moreh court ruling in 1979, Israel was able to more than double the amount of&#160;<br/>state land in the West Bank within 13 years such that it constituted about 25% of the territory by 1992.573&#160;It&#160;<br/>had increased it to around 27% of the West Bank by 2010.574<br/>
Meanwhile, in annexed East Jerusalem, Israel’s non-registration of Palestinians’ land titles has been one of&#160;<br/>the key obstacles to urban planning and contributed to home demolitions over the years as registration of&#160;<br/>ownership is one of the conditions for issuing building permits. The freeze on land settlement persisted until&#160;<br/>the adoption of Government Resolution 3790 in 2018, a five-year plan&#160;apparently aimed at “narrowing socio-<br/>economic gaps and economic development in East Jerusalem” (see section 5.5.3 “Discriminatory provision&#160;<br/>of services”). In addition to deepening Israel’s control over East Jerusalem in general, and failing to meet the&#160;<br/>population’s needs, the plan envisages the full settlement and registration of land rights in East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>

<a name=128></a>by 2025. While some Palestinians could obtain legal ownership of their lands through this process, Israeli&#160;<br/>organizations have warned that the mechanism could be misused to register lands to the state or Jewish&#160;<br/>individuals claiming ownership over property purchased before 1948 based on the provisions of the Legal&#160;<br/>and Administrative Matters Law of 1970 and the Absentees’ Property Law, without addressing Palestinian&#160;<br/>property claims or the rights of long-term Palestinian residents.575&#160;As a result, it could become another major&#160;<br/>tool of furthering Palestinian dispossession in the city for the purpose of maintaining a Jewish majority.<br/>
Indeed, in 2020, the Israeli authorities initiated land registration procedures in the Umm Haroun area&#160;<br/>of Sheikh Jarrah based on Government Resolution 3790 in the first land&#160;settlement process they had&#160;<br/>undertaken in East Jerusalem since the beginning of the occupation in 1967. They did so without informing&#160;<br/>the public or the 45 Palestinian families residing in the area, and exclusively registered properties under&#160;<br/>the alleged ownership of Jewish owners. The land registration process is being carried out the same time&#160;<br/>as ongoing eviction lawsuits filed against Palestinian families in Sheikh&#160;Jarrah by settler organizations (see&#160;<br/>section 5.4.3 “Discriminatory allocation of expropriated Palestinian land for Jewish settlement”). A petition by&#160;<br/>residents and two Israeli human rights group demanding the immediate freeze of land registration in Umm&#160;<br/>Haroun was pending before the Israeli Supreme Court as of the end of August 2021.576&#160;<br/>
In the Gaza Strip, about 30% of the land remained unregistered in 1949 when Egypt took control over the&#160;<br/>territory. The Egyptian authorities took some steps to protect land ownership rights, and allowed individuals&#160;<br/>who were in physical possession of the land to register it under their name upon payment of a tax. Still,&#160;<br/>many landowners chose to only register parts of their land, or not to register it at all, in order to avoid the tax&#160;<br/>and, as a result, large parts of Gaza remained unregistered. This also facilitated the Israeli process of land&#160;<br/>confiscation for the construction of Israeli settlements following the occupation.577<br/>
<b>5.4.3 DISCRIMINATORY ALLOCATION OF EXPROPRIATED PALESTINIAN&#160;</b><br/>
<b>LAND FOR JEWISH SETTLEMENT&#160;<br/></b>In parallel to the mass land expropriations from Palestinians to the Israeli state and Jewish organizations, the&#160;<br/>Israeli government enabled Jewish localities and settlements to use the expropriated lands. In Israel and East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, it transferred land from the state to Jewish national organizations and institutions, many of which&#160;<br/>serve Jews only, while the legal title of the land remained in the state’s name. Some 93% of land in Israel&#160;<br/>and occupied East Jerusalem, comprising around 19.5 million dunams (1.95 million hectares), is now state&#160;<br/>land. The residual 7% of land in Israel is owned by private individuals.578&#160;Jewish Israelis own over half of this,&#160;<br/>that is around 3.5% to 4% of the total land.579&#160;About 80% of Palestinian citizens of Israel are packed into the&#160;<br/>remaining 3% to 3.5% of the land.580&#160;&#160;<br/>
In the rest of the OPT, the Israeli government adopted policies that allowed the allocation of state land almost&#160;<br/>exclusively to Israeli state institutions and organizations, and state and private companies, for the benefit of&#160;<br/>Jewish Israeli settlers.581<br/>

<a name=129></a><b>LAND ALLOCATION FOR JEWISH LOCALITIES IN ISRAEL &#160;<br/></b>Some 93% of land in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, comprising around 19.5 million dunams&#160;<br/>(1.95 million hectares), is now state land. The Israel Land Authority, a state body that succeeded the&#160;<br/>Israel Land Administration in 2009, administers state land in Israel and its Council determines how&#160;<br/>the land is managed and allocated.582&#160;The Council is made up of 14 members including the minister&#160;<br/>of housing as chair, seven representatives of government ministries and six representatives of the JNF/<br/>KKL, making it a national institution that explicitly privileges Jews.583<br/>
State land in Israel is largely used to develop Jewish towns and other localities. Palestinian citizens&#160;<br/>of Israel face severe restrictions in accessing state land for their development. They are effectively&#160;<br/>blocked from leasing land on 80% of state land.584&#160;This is the consequence of exclusionary and&#160;<br/>discriminatory policies pursued by Israeli state authorities and Jewish national institutions as well as&#160;<br/>residence restrictions based on “admissions committees” (see below) to newly established localities&#160;<br/>and neighbourhoods.585<br/>
Jewish national institutions in Israel have played a significant&#160;role in the expropriation of Palestinian&#160;<br/>land before and since the creation of Israel in 1948. The World Zionist Organization (WZO) was&#160;<br/>established in 1897 and “carried the main responsibility for establishing the State of Israel” as the&#160;<br/>main body representing Jewish communities. In 1901, the WZO established the JNF/KKL specifically&#160;<br/>to acquire land in Palestine for “the purpose of settling Jews on such lands and properties.”586&#160;The&#160;<br/>Jewish Agency for Israel, which was set up in 1929 as the operative branch of the WZO, assists and&#160;<br/>encourages Jewish people to settle in Israel. &#160;It was chaired between 1935 and 1948 by David Ben-<br/>Gurion, who became Israel’s first prime minister.587<br/>
Under the World Zionist Organization – Jewish Agency (Status) Law of 1952, the WZO retained a formal&#160;<br/>status as a quasi-governmental institution responsible for handling Jewish immigration, absorption and&#160;<br/>settlement in Israel.588&#160;Both the WZO and the Jewish Agency for Israel have been involved since 1948&#160;<br/>in managing and leasing state land from the Israel Land Administration, and subsequently the Israel&#160;<br/>Land Authority, to settle Jewish immigrants in Israel, a use of state land which excludes non-Jews.&#160;<br/>
Before 1948, the JNF/KKL acquired a little over 800,000 dunams in Palestine.589&#160;Following the&#160;<br/>establishment of Israel, the JNF/KKL continued to act as a custodian and trustee of “Jewish national&#160;<br/>land”.590&#160;The JNF/KKL also played a crucial role as a company registered in Israel that performed certain&#160;<br/>state functions on the basis of the Jewish National Fund Law of 1953. The law grants the JNF/KKL a&#160;<br/>special status in designing Israel’s land policies in general and entitles it to tax breaks and financial&#160;<br/>benefits, while retaining semi-governmental functions.591&#160;Its remit includes the purchase and acquisition&#160;<br/>of lands and assets in areas in Israel or “in any area subject to the jurisdiction of the Government&#160;<br/>of Israel” for the purpose of settling Jews on them, and the reclamation and development of land in&#160;<br/>

<a name=130></a>Israel.592&#160;After the purchase of 2 million dunams (the “two million deal”) from the state in 1949 and&#160;<br/>1950, the JNF/KKL became the largest agricultural landowner in Israel, serving Jews only, as per its&#160;<br/>charter.593&#160;In addition, the JNF/KKL purchased some 360 properties in the West Bank, and claims to be&#160;<br/>able to prove ownership for approximately 170 of them. Most of these purchase deals were completed&#160;<br/>by Himnuta, a subsidiary of JNF/KKL (see section 5.4.1 “Land expropriation laws and policies”),&#160;<br/>following the start of Israel’s occupation in 1967. Some were bought before 1948 directly by JNF/KKL.594<br/>
In 1960, the Knesset passed the Israel Land Administration Law.595&#160;This established the Israel Land&#160;<br/>Administration (which became the Israel Land Authority in 2009) to administer state land along with&#160;<br/>the Development Authority and the JNF/KKL. That same year the Knesset passed the Basic Law:&#160;<br/>Israel Lands, which prevented the sale of land by the Israel Land Administration but allows the lease&#160;<br/>of state land to the public, the JNF/KKL or the WZO and the Jewish Agency for Israel for up to 98&#160;<br/>years. Under Article 1 of the law, “The ownership of Israel lands, being the lands in Israel of the State,&#160;<br/>the Development Authority or the Keren Kayemet Le-Israel [JNF/KKL], shall not be transferred either&#160;<br/>by sale or in any other manner.”596&#160;A year later, the administration of the JNF/KKL land passed to the&#160;<br/>Israel Land Administration.597<br/>
Jewish national bodies generally do not lease land to non-Jews and do not accept them in the housing&#160;<br/>projects and/or communities they establish and other housing projects on state lands that have&#160;<br/>been developed specifically for new Jewish immigrants. About 13%&#160;of state land in Israel, or over&#160;<br/>2.5 million dunams, is owned and administered solely through the JNF/KKL for use by Jews.598&#160;The&#160;<br/>discriminatory allocation of state land by the Israel Land Administration to the JNF/KKL, which in turn&#160;<br/>only developed the land exclusively for Jewish Israelis, was legally challenged in 2000. In the&#160;<i>Ka’adan</i>&#160;<br/>ruling, the Supreme Court of Israel held that the state cannot discriminate in the allocation of land on&#160;<br/>the basis of religion or nationality, after a Palestinian couple attempted to buy land in a Jewish locality&#160;<br/>established by the JNF/KKL on previously public land that had been allocated to it by the Israel Land&#160;<br/>Administration.599&#160;The new village had a committee to admit members who could become residents;&#160;<br/>one of its admission conditions was military service. The court ruled that this resulted in discriminatory&#160;<br/>land allocation. However, the decision stated that its impact was not retroactive. Hence, all past&#160;<br/>discriminatory land dispossession and allocation would not be scrutinized.&#160;<br/>
Following the&#160;<i>Ka’adan</i>&#160;ruling, the prevention of Palestinian citizens of Israel from leasing land from&#160;<br/>the&#160;JNF/KKL became less categorical, but it remains extremely rare for Palestinians to be able to do so&#160;<br/>even on new allocations. This is partly because the new allocations are generally for the expansion of&#160;<br/>Jewish communities and not Palestinian ones. It is partly because new localities began to utilize other&#160;<br/>means of profiling and selecting the residents. The exclusion of&#160;Palestinian citizens of Israel from state&#160;<br/>land continued, and Jewish national institutions retained their formal status in Israel’s land policies and&#160;<br/>

<a name=131></a>development. In 2007, CERD called on Israel to ensure that the WZO, including the Jewish Agency for&#160;<br/>Israel, and the JNF/KKL are bound by the principle of non-discrimination in the exercise of their functions.600&#160;<br/>
To circumvent the potential implications of the&#160;<i>Ka’adan</i>&#160;ruling, the Knesset passed in 2011 the&#160;<br/>Communities Acceptance Law. This allows “admissions committees” to determine who can be admitted&#160;<br/>to Jewish communities of fewer than 400 households in the Negev/Naqab and Galilee areas. Under the&#160;<br/>Law to Amend the Cooperative Societies Ordinance (No. 8), the “admissions committees” can base their&#160;<br/>selection on a set of vague standards, including the candidate’s “social suitability” or lack of “compatibility&#160;<br/>with the social and cultural fabric” of the community, which is determined based on a “professional&#160;<br/>opinion by someone who is expert in identifying such suitability.”601&#160;An “admissions committee” is made&#160;<br/>up of five members, including three representatives of the community, one representative of the WZO and&#160;<br/>the Jewish Agency for Israel, and one representative of the regional council that has jurisdiction over the&#160;<br/>community.602&#160;The functioning of the committees is not subject to any supervision by the Israeli authorities.<br/>
Adalah has shown that the primary objective of the law is to further marginalize Palestinian citizens of&#160;<br/>Israel and other marginalized groups in Israel, and to maintain segregation in housing and residence&#160;<br/>based on national identity.603&#160;The “admissions committees” operate in 695 agricultural towns and&#160;<br/>communities in Israel, which are distributed in 53 regional councils throughout the country that control&#160;<br/>around 81% of state land in Israel (excluding Jewish Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank&#160;<br/>and Golan Heights).604&#160;For instance, in 2017 a new Jewish town scheduled to be built on the ruins of&#160;<br/>a Palestinian Bedouin village in the Negev/Naqab specified in its bylaws that the town’s “admissions&#160;<br/>committee” would only permit the admittance of individuals to the town “if they meet the following&#160;<br/>qualifications: a Jewish Israeli citizen or permanent resident&#160;of Israel who observes the Torah and&#160;<br/>commandments according to Orthodox Jewish values…”605&#160;In 2019, Adalah found that over 20 other&#160;<br/>villages had established “admissions committees” despite having more than 400 households, in&#160;<br/>violation of the terms of the Law to Amend the Cooperative Societies Ordinance (No. 8).606&#160;<br/>
<b>SETTLEMENT EXPANSION AND STATE-SUPPORTED LAND GRABS BY SETTLERS IN EAST JERUSALEM &#160;&#160;<br/></b>Israel’s land policies and practices in East Jerusalem, after&#160;its occupation in 1967, reflect similar legal&#160;<br/>patterns to those in Israel, although it pursued its allocation of land for Jewish settlements and other&#160;<br/>localities in East Jerusalem with even more intensity due to the special status and significance of the&#160;<br/>city of Jerusalem in Israeli politics.&#160;<br/>
By 2017, some 38% of land in East Jerusalem had been expropriated from Palestinians, most of it&#160;<br/>privately owned.607&#160;The Israeli government first confiscated close to 4,000 dunams in East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>to build the Jewish settlements of French Hill – Ramat Eshkol and Ma’alot Dafna – and then in&#160;<br/>April 1968 confiscated nearly 1,000 dunams to build Neve Ya’aqov, and an additional 116 dunams&#160;<br/>for the Jewish Quarter in the Old City.

<a name=132></a>expropriated; even though Israel refers to them as neighbourhoods of Jerusalem, they are illegal&#160;<br/>under international law.608&#160;The settlements were built in strategic locations to surround Palestinian&#160;<br/>neighbourhoods and therefore disrupt Palestinians’ geographic contiguity and urban development.609&#160;<br/>Most of these confiscations took place under the Land Ordinance&#160;(Acquisition for Public Purposes)&#160;<br/>of 1943. As of July 2021, there were 225,178 Israeli Jewish Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem and&#160;<br/>358,800 Palestinians.610<br/>
<b>JUDAIZATION OF JERUSALEM: DEMOLITION OF MUGHRABI QUARTER &#160;</b><br/>
The first organized mass home demolitions by Israeli forces took place&#160;between 10 and 12 June 1967&#160;<br/>at the end of the Six-Day War, in the Mughrabi (Moroccan) Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The&#160;<br/>demolitions were ordered to create what became known as the Western Wall Plaza.611&#160;On 10 June 1967,&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities, on the orders of Jerusalem’s then mayor Teddy Kolek, instructed 650 Palestinians to&#160;<br/>leave their homes immediately. The day after, Israeli authorities bulldozed 138 buildings and attempted&#160;<br/>to erase the Mughrabi Quarter, an area erected eight centuries earlier that included historic buildings&#160;<br/>and was home to the Moroccan community of Jerusalem.612&#160;A further 15 Palestinian buildings in the&#160;<br/>quarter were later destroyed in 1981. The residents were displaced to different places around the world.613&#160;&#160;<br/>
This was one of the first steps taken by Israeli authorities to change&#160;the geography and demography of&#160;<br/>the Old City in Jerusalem. Seeking to rebuild and expand the Jewish Quarter and to make the Western&#160;<br/>Wall Plaza, the Israeli government formally confiscated in April 1968&#160;the lands of the Mughrabi Quarter,&#160;<br/>Al-Sharaf neighbourhood and the Jewish neighbourhood, totalling 116 dunams (about 137 dunams&#160;<br/>by 2011 following further expropriations).614&#160;The Israeli authorities prohibited Palestinian families from&#160;<br/>buying apartments in the newly constructed blocks in the Jewish Quarter.615<br/>
In addition to the Israeli state’s allocation of confiscated&#160;Palestinian land for advancing Jewish&#160;<br/>settlement in Jerusalem, Jewish settler organizations have relied on the Absentees’ Property Law and&#160;<br/>the Legal and Administrative Matters Law to devise a legal scheme to dispossess Palestinians of their&#160;<br/>properties, allow Jewish settlers to settle in predominantly Palestinian neighbourhoods and further&#160;<br/>the expansion of Jewish settlements. Land and property grabs by settler organizations have taken&#160;<br/>place with the assistance of state institutions, including the Custodian General, the JNF/KKL and the&#160;<br/>judiciary.<br/>

<a name=133></a>In most cases, Jewish settler organizations (for example, Ateret Cohanim and Elad) have reached out&#160;<br/>to the Jewish owners or their heirs and bought the rights to properties that belonged to Jewish owners&#160;<br/>in 1948. The settler organizations have then asked the Custodian General to transfer, or release,&#160;<br/>the management and rights over these properties to them, even if these properties are inhabited by&#160;<br/>Palestinian families who have lived in them since as far back as 1948. The releases have enabled the&#160;<br/>settler organizations to initiate eviction lawsuits against the Palestinian families living in the properties.616&#160;<br/>
Tens of properties have been released under this law to Jewish individuals and organizations.&#160;<br/>According to OCHA estimates in 2019, there were 199 Palestinian families, comprising 877 people,&#160;<br/>facing eviction cases and at risk of displacement.617&#160;Most of these cases are in the Old City and the&#160;<br/>neighbourhoods of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan. The Israeli government tries to depict such eviction&#160;<br/>cases as merely civil lawsuits over disputed properties between different individual parties.618&#160;However,&#160;<br/>the eviction of Palestinian families and the settling of Jewish settler families in these properties&#160;<br/>in predominantly Palestinian neighbourhoods brings with it much distress, dire humanitarian&#160;<br/>consequences and creates a coercive environment for the local Palestinians.619&#160;Crucially, these eviction&#160;<br/>lawsuits are part of a coordinated campaign aimed at consolidating Israeli control over the areas,&#160;<br/>forcibly transferring Palestinians and establishing Jewish Israeli presence in their place. They are based&#160;<br/>on laws that are inherently discriminatory against Palestinians and offer only limited legal recourse to&#160;<br/>them, with courts regularly upholding eviction claims by settlers.620<br/>
In other examples such as the case of the Umm Haroun area of Sheikh Jarrah, the Custodian General&#160;<br/>has sold lands to Jewish settler groups and initiated eviction cases against Palestinian families.621<br/>
<b>SHEIKH JARRAH &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
Sheikh Jarrah is a Palestinian residential neighbourhood to the north of the Old City in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>It has been a target of a sustained campaign to step up forced evictions of Palestinian residents to make&#160;<br/>way for Israeli settlers. According to OCHA, since 2009 there have been 21 demolitions in Sheikh Jarrah&#160;<br/>(as of 31 July 2021).622<br/>
Seven Palestinians families in Sheikh Jarrah are facing imminent threat of forced eviction from their&#160;<br/>homes after the settler company Nahalat Shimon International filed&#160;lawsuits in 2008 with the Jerusalem&#160;<br/>Magistrates’ Court to seize their homes, referring to inherently discriminatory laws such as the Legal and&#160;<br/>Administrative Matters Law and the Absentees’ Property Law.623&#160;Following lengthy legal processes, on 4&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=134></a>September 2020, the Jerusalem Magistrates’ Court ordered the eviction of three families – the Hammad,&#160;<br/>Daoudi and Dajani families – by no later than 1 August 2021. The court also ordered the families to pay&#160;<br/>NIS 30,000 (USD 9,677) for Nahalat Shimon International’s court fees and legal expenses. On 4 March&#160;<br/>2021, the Jerusalem District Court rejected an appeal by the three families.624&#160;On 8 October 2020, the&#160;<br/>court had ordered the eviction of a further four families – the Skafi, Al-Kurd, Abu Hasaneh and Jaouni&#160;<br/>families. On 10 February 2021, following an appeal by three of the families, the Jerusalem District Court&#160;<br/>dismissed the appeal and ordered them to vacate their homes by 2 May 2021.625&#160;&#160;<br/>
In response to the imminent forced eviction of the seven Palestinian families, Palestinians held nightly&#160;<br/>demonstrations in the neighbourhood in early May 2021.The families also launched a campaign on&#160;<br/>social media under the hashtag #SaveSheikhJarrah attracting worldwide attention and mobilizing&#160;<br/>protesters on the ground. On 18 May 2021, Palestinians across cities and villages in Israel and the&#160;<br/>occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip closed their offices, shops, restaurants&#160;and schools, abandoned&#160;<br/>construction sites, and refused to report to work for the whole day. In a display of unity not seen for&#160;<br/>decades, they defied the territorial fragmentation and segregation they face in their daily lives and&#160;<br/>observed a general strike to protest their shared repression by Israel.&#160;<br/>
On 19 May 2021, Israeli authorities declared Sheikh Jarrah a closed military zone and limited&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ entry into the neighbourhood, while allowing freedom of movement to Jewish settlers.626&#160;&#160;<br/>Palestinian residents continued to demonstrate outside their homes. Israeli security forces responded&#160;<br/>to the protests with arbitrary arrests of peaceful demonstrators, the use of excessive force, arbitrary use&#160;<br/>of sound and stun grenades as well as arbitrary spraying of skunk water at demonstrators and homes&#160;<br/>in Sheikh Jarrah.627&#160;They also fired concussion grenades at worshippers and protesters gathered in the&#160;<br/>Al-Aqsa mosque compound of the Old City in East Jerusalem.<br/>
The repression generated a wave of solidarity elsewhere in the OPT and amongst Palestinian citizens of&#160;<br/>Israel, across the Green Line. By coming out to protest, they were expressing unity, and a rejection of&#160;<br/>Israel’s fragmentation of the Palestinian people. A manifesto published on social media by some activists&#160;<br/>denounced Israel’s long-standing practices and policies that “tried to turn [Palestinians] into different&#160;<br/>societies, each living apart, each in its own separate prison”.628<br/>
Following the nightly demonstrations and international pressure, the Israeli Supreme Court postponed&#160;<br/>the hearing at the request of the Israeli attorney general, on grounds related to national security and so&#160;<br/>that he would have sufficient time to weigh his potential involvement in the case on behalf of the state.629&#160;&#160;<br/>The attorney general later informed the Israeli Supreme Court that he would not intervene in the eviction&#160;<br/>case.630&#160;As of the end of August 2021, the outcome in the case was still pending.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=137></a>Silwan is another area in East Jerusalem which has been facing immense pressure from ideologically&#160;<br/>driven Israeli settler organizations that attempt to take over their lands and homes based on inherently&#160;<br/>discriminatory laws and with the full backing of state institutions. It is also a case which illustrates Israel’s use&#160;<br/>of archaeological sites and nature reserves in East Jerusalem to minimize Palestinian development in the city&#160;<br/>and consolidate Jewish control over strategic areas.<br/>
<b>JUDAIZATION OF SILWAN &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
In 1967, Silwan village, located on the southern outskirts of the Old City of Jerusalem, became part of&#160;<br/>annexed East Jerusalem. Today, around 40,000 to 45,000 Palestinians live there and it is extremely&#160;<br/>overcrowded.631&#160;The village became home to Palestinian refugees from, among other places, West&#160;<br/>Jerusalem after 1948 and from the Mughrabi Quarter of the Old City after 1967. In recent decades,&#160;<br/>Silwan – primarily two of its neighbourhoods, Wadi Hilweh and Batn Al-Hawa – has been targeted for&#160;<br/>Jewish settlement, led mainly by two Jewish settler organizations – Elad and Ateret Cohanim – backed&#160;<br/>by the Israeli government.632&#160;Both organizations work to displace Palestinian families living in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem through the Custodian of Absentee Property in order to hand over their homes to Jewish&#160;<br/>settlers, and have spearheaded forced evictions in Silwan.633<br/>
The first major Judaization project in Silwan was the establishment in 1974 of the Ir David (City of David)&#160;<br/>National Park in the western part of the neighbourhood of Al-Bustan, instituted by the Israel Nature&#160;<br/>and Parks Authority as part of a green belt around the Old City of Jerusalem.634&#160;Elad, together with then&#160;<br/>housing minister Ariel Sharon, sought to build an additional 200 housing units for Jewish Israeli settlers&#160;<br/>in 1992 on the archaeological site. The Israel Antiquities Authority objected and the project was stopped.&#160;<br/>Indeed, archaeologists and the Israel Antiquities Authority accused the director of Elad of destroying&#160;<br/>historical and archaeological sites.635&#160;However, in 1997, the Israel Land Administration transferred state&#160;<br/>lands in Silwan to Elad.636&#160;Then, in 2005, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority allowed Elad to operate&#160;<br/>the City of David site. That same year, the Israeli government allocated an annual budget of NIS 50&#160;<br/>million over eight years as part of a plan to develop and preserve the Holy Basin around the Old City. A&#160;<br/>significant part of this plan is carried out in collaboration with Elad. A&#160;JNF/KKL report shows the strong&#160;<br/>connection between the JNF/KKL and Elad in transferring properties to Elad and facilitating its Jewish&#160;<br/>settlement enterprise in Silwan.637<br/>
Over the years Elad has closely supported the Israeli government in expanding the settlement&#160;<br/>compounds in Silwan, especially in the Al-Bustan neighbourhood. The organization hires well-resourced&#160;<br/>

<a name=138></a>lawyers to file lengthy and exhausting lawsuits against Palestinian families.638&#160;It has successfully taken&#160;<br/>over approximately 75 Palestinian homes in the Wadi Hilweh neighbourhood of Silwan.639&#160;<br/>
In its early years, Elad acquired Palestinian-owned buildings in Silwan, evicting Palestinian residents&#160;<br/>and replacing them with Jewish settlers,640&#160;with a declared aim of Judaizing East Jerusalem.641&#160;Elad’s&#160;<br/>settlement activity in Silwan began in 1991 with the confiscation of the&#160;property of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>Abbasi family in Wadi Hilweh neighbourhood as an “absentee property”.642&#160;To this end, years earlier,&#160;<br/>the founding director of Elad, David Beeri, had taken a friend’s tour guide card, changed the photo on&#160;<br/>it for his own, brought fake tour groups through the area and, over time, established a friendship with&#160;<br/>the Abbasi family, who invited him into their home.643&#160;By gaining the family’s trust, David Beeri learned&#160;<br/>that some family members were “absentees” living in Arab countries. Together with the lawyers of Ateret&#160;<br/>Cohanim and the Israel Land Administration, he called on the Custodian of Absentee Property to declare&#160;<br/>the home as an “absentee property”.644&#160;The Custodian of Absentee Property obliged in 1987. In 1991,&#160;<br/>a joint committee which included the Ministry of Housing and David Beeri, representing Elad, decided&#160;<br/>to lease the home to Elad. Following the decision, Elad evicted the Abbasi family and David Beeri moved&#160;<br/>in, despite a court ruling that the declaration of the home as an “absentee property” was based on a&#160;<br/>false deposition, with “no factual or legal basis” and that the entire process was tainted by “extreme lack&#160;<br/>of good faith”.645&#160;In 2017, David Beeri was awarded the Israel Prize for special contribution to society&#160;<br/>and the state for his role with Elad.646<br/>
Since then, Elad, through its agents and enabled by the Israeli legal system, has continued to take over&#160;<br/>properties in Silwan, and has initiated plans to expand the area designated for tourism into Silwan,&#160;<br/>placing some 88 Palestinian homes in al-Bustan neighbourhood at risk of demolition for unlicensed&#160;<br/>building as a result of discriminatory planning and building policies.647&#160;In the past 13 years, the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities have demolished some 164 structures in Silwan, displacing 260 Palestinians, including 186&#160;<br/>children (see section 6.1.2 “Israeli policies and practices”).648<br/>

<a name=139></a>Elad, with the support of the Israeli government, has further ambitious – and controversial – plans to&#160;<br/>build a massive new visitor complex and cable car station for the City of David tourist site with the aim&#160;<br/>of drawing millions of tourists into the area.649&#160;Elad is also proposing to turn part of the City of David&#160;<br/>into a large residential complex for Israeli settlers.650&#160;The use of archaeology and tourism by the Israeli&#160;<br/>government and Elad as a cover for forcibly displacing the Palestinian residents of Silwan and installing&#160;<br/>Jewish settlers has been widely criticized.651&#160;Digital tourism companies have also contributed to the&#160;<br/>illegal situation created by the presence and growth of settlement enclaves in East Jerusalem.652&#160;<br/>
In parallel, since 2001, Ateret Cohanim has been trying, with the support of Israeli authorities, to forcibly&#160;<br/>evict 84 Palestinian families from Batn al-Hawa neighbourhood, claiming the land is rightfully owned by&#160;<br/>a Jewish trust active in the area more than 100 years ago.653<br/>
In 2001, three people affiliated with Ateret Cohanim were appointed&#160;as trustees of an old Jewish&#160;<br/>endowment and in 2002 the Custodian General transferred land in the Batn Al-Hawa neighbourhood to&#160;<br/>the settler organization. This allows Ateret Cohanim to make eviction claims on Palestinian families who&#160;<br/>built their homes lawfully after 1948 and to purchase additional tracts of land previously managed by the&#160;<br/>Custodian General.654&#160;Ateret Cohanim has been accused of using methods that include bribery, straw&#160;<br/>companies and the exploitation of legal technicalities to gain ownership of Palestinian homes.655&#160;<br/>
Today, Ateret Cohanim plays an active role in detecting unlicensed construction and provides&#160;<br/>information to the relevant municipal units, which later appropriate the land.656&#160;According to the Israeli&#160;<br/>NGO Peace Now, Ateret Cohanim has filed eviction lawsuits against 84 Palestinian families living in the&#160;<br/>Batn Al-Hawa area of Silwan, putting 700 Palestinians at risk of being forcibly evicted.657&#160;According to Ir&#160;<br/>Amim, an Israeli rights group that focuses on Jerusalem:&#160;<br/>
<i>The Ateret Cohanim settler organization is waging one of the most comprehensive state-backed&#160;<br/>settler takeover campaigns in East Jerusalem through initiating mass eviction proceedings against&#160;<br/>Palestinian families in Batan Al-Hawa.658</i><br/>

On 24 November 2020, Jerusalem Magistrates’ Court ordered the eviction of eight Palestinian families in&#160;<br/>Batn Al-Hawa to be replaced by settlers.659&#160;<br/>
Jewish settlements, houses and compounds in the heart of Palestinian neighbourhoods have a disastrous&#160;<br/>impact not only on the displaced Palestinian families, but also on the entire neighbourhood and daily life&#160;<br/>of the Palestinians. Settlers are usually armed, and their compounds are fenced and protected by private&#160;<br/>security companies, which leads to friction with the local Palestinians. In several cases, these tensions&#160;<br/>have led to violent confrontations that usually end with the arrest and injury of Palestinians, including&#160;<br/>children. The settlers’ control over land and property in Silwan has also led to the fencing of these sites,&#160;<br/>blocking passages that served the local Palestinian population and disrupting their lives.<br/>

<b>LAND ALLOCATION FOR CONTINUED ILLEGAL SETTLEMENT EXPANSION IN OPT &#160;<br/></b>Establishing and promoting Israeli settlements in the OPT and populating them with Jewish Israeli&#160;<br/>civilians has been an Israeli government policy since 1967.&#160;The first Israeli settlement of Kfar Etzion&#160;<br/>was created in the south of the occupied West Bank just three months into the occupation, in&#160;<br/>September 1967.&#160;<br/>
As explained above, Israeli settlements and their related infrastructure were initially built on privately&#160;<br/>owned land that was requisitioned for “military needs” or expropriated for “public purposes”. Between&#160;<br/>1967 and 1979, some 47,000 dunams were requisitioned for the construction of 14 settlements.660&#160;<br/>The settlement enterprise gained pace with the policy shift towards “state land declarations” following&#160;<br/>the 1979 Elon Moreh Supreme Court ruling (see section 5.4.1 “Land expropriation laws and policies”).&#160;<br/>Between 1967 and 2009, Israel had increased the total area of state land from some 530,000 dunams&#160;<br/>to 1.4 million dunams, the vast majority of it located in Area C of the West Bank, and allocated nearly&#160;<br/>

<a name=142></a>half of it for civilian use. Of this, some 99.76% (674,459 dunams) was allocated for the exclusive&#160;<br/>benefit of Israeli settlements, according to information provided by the Israeli military in 2018 to&#160;<br/>Peace Now.661&#160;According to data obtained by ACRI in 2013, the Israeli Civil Administration allocated&#160;<br/>approximately a third of state land to the WZO (for the development of settlements), while the rest&#160;<br/>was allocated to Israeli ministries, state companies, local and regional councils and mobile phone&#160;<br/>companies. By contrast, Palestinians have been allocated only 1,625 dunams.662&#160;<br/>
Such a discriminatory allocation of state land was authorized under Government Resolution 730 of&#160;<br/>1979, which allowed the use of state land for three purposes only: military facilities, Jewish settlements&#160;<br/>and housing for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As a result of this decision, state&#160;<br/>land in the OPT can be allocated for Palestinian construction&#160;only for the benefit of refugees, while the&#160;<br/>rest of the population must use privately owned land.663&#160;<br/>
Further, much of the state land allocated by Israel for settlement construction and expansion is located&#160;<br/>on the central mountain ridge in the West Bank, in areas surrounding Palestinian villages. This process&#160;<br/>therefore contributed hugely not only to dispossessing Palestinians of a vital resource but also to the&#160;<br/>fragmentation of Palestinian land into separate enclaves, restricting their natural growth, and ensuring&#160;<br/>a geographic domination of Israeli settlements located on hilltops over Palestinian villages in cultivated&#160;<br/>valleys.664<br/>
All Israeli settlements in the OPT are illegal under international law, regardless of their status under&#160;<br/>Israeli law.665&#160;As already mentioned, there are currently more than 441,600 Jewish settlers in the West&#160;<br/>Bank excluding East Jerusalem.666&#160;Their presence is illegal under international humanitarian law. They&#160;<br/>live in 132 settlements that have been officially established by&#160;the Israeli government, as well as 140&#160;<br/>unauthorized outposts that have been established since the 1990s without government approval and&#160;<br/>are considered illegal even under Israeli law.667&#160;In practice, the outposts are backed by senior officials&#160;<br/>and military officers, and Israeli authorities often immediately&#160;connect them to services such as water&#160;<br/>and electricity, to be authorized retroactively.668&#160;In February 2017, the Knesset adopted the Law for the&#160;<br/>Regularization of Settlement in Judea and Samaria to allow Israeli authorities to expropriate privately&#160;<br/>owned Palestinian land and retroactively “regularize” settlements and outposts built on such land.669&#160;<br/>The law was suspended shortly after, and the Supreme Court of Israel ruled in June 2020 that the law&#160;<br/>was unconstitutional.670<br/>
Today, Israeli settlements cover nearly 10% of the West Bank, and their regional councils have&#160;<br/>jurisdiction over 1.65 million dunams of land in Area C – roughly 63% of Area C (or 40% of the&#160;<br/>West Bank) where most settlers live.671&#160;Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip are banned&#160;<br/>from using this land, which is declared a closed military zone, and can only enter it as workers&#160;<br/>

Over 400km of bypass&#160;<br/>roads that connect Israeli settlements are inaccessible or only partially accessible to Palestinians.673&#160;<br/>Further, the route of the fence/wall has been designed to encircle many Israeli settlements and&#160;<br/>effectively bars thousands of Palestinians from their agricultural land in addition to fragmenting the&#160;<br/>West Bank into separate enclaves.674<br/>
Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are meant to be permanent places of&#160;<br/>residence or economic activity for Jewish Israelis and are built solely to serve their needs. Successive&#160;<br/>Israeli governments have unequivocally supported the expansion of Israeli settlements in the OPT,&#160;<br/>through a combination of legal and administrative measures.675&#160;Israel has channelled and applied its&#160;<br/>own civil legislation through military orders that have enabled the authority of governmental institutions&#160;<br/>to be extended within the boundaries of the settlements.676&#160;It also provides subsidies, tax incentives&#160;<br/>and low-cost utilities and resources to encourage Jewish Israelis to live in these places and to support&#160;<br/>the settlement economy.677&#160;The settlement economy, which sustains the presence and the expansion&#160;<br/>of settlements, straddles the construction, agriculture, manufacturing, services and tourism sectors.<br/>
The impact of this discriminatory land regime is perhaps best&#160;exemplified in the Jordan Valley where&#160;<br/>the vast majority of Palestinian land has been allocated to serve Israeli interest and enable authorities&#160;<br/>to exploit Palestinian resources with even greater intensity than elsewhere in the West Bank in line&#160;<br/>with their stated intent to fully control and even annex the area (see section 5.1 “Intent to oppress and&#160;<br/>dominate the Palestinian people”).&#160;<br/>
<b>JORDAN VALLEY &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
The Jordan Valley constitutes almost 30% of the West Bank and 40% of Area C. Nearly 90% of the&#160;<br/>Jordan Valley has been designated as Area C, under full Israeli control, where about 65,000 Palestinians&#160;<br/>live in over 50 communities and some 11,000 Israeli settlers live in 36 illegal Israeli settlements and&#160;<br/>18 outposts that are illegal even under Israeli law.678&#160;The remaining 10% is home to Palestinian towns&#160;<br/>and cities, including Jericho, located in areas designated as A or B under the Oslo Accords. These&#160;<br/>Palestinian communities are enclaved by Area C and are effectively cut off from each other and the rest&#160;<br/>of the Jordan Valley.679<br/>
The Jordan Valley contains some of the OPT’s most fertile lands. In addition, it is scarcely populated&#160;<br/>and includes the largest land reserves in the West Bank, making it the most suitable area for any future&#160;<br/>

They have barred Palestinians from using, or even entering, 85% of the area by allocating the land&#160;<br/>for several different, sometimes overlapping, purposes thus enabling it to consolidate its control over&#160;<br/>land whilst excluding its Palestinian population. As stated above, in the early years of the occupation,&#160;<br/>the Israeli authorities allocated thousands of dunams of absentee land for military bases and&#160;<br/>settlement construction. As of the end of 2017, nearly 50% of the Jordan Valley had been designated&#160;<br/>as state land, while 46% had been declared a “closed military area”, including “firing zones” and&#160;<br/>settlements’ jurisdictional areas, effectively making it off-limits to Palestinians. Some 20% was&#160;<br/>allocated to nature reserves; two thirds of this land were also&#160;declared military “firing zones”.680&#160;<br/>Many of these “firing zones” are placed in some of the most marginalized communities in the Jordan&#160;<br/>Valley.681&#160;The Israeli army routinely demolishes Palestinian homes and structures in these “firing&#160;<br/>zones” (see section 6.1.2 “Israeli policies and practices”); by contrast, the Israel authorities have&#160;<br/>changed the status of some “of these “firing zones” to allow for&#160;the expansion of Israeli settlements&#160;<br/>located partially or completely in them.682&#160;Palestinian residents face settler violence, harassment by&#160;<br/>soldiers and access restrictions, all contributing to a coercive environment that puts pressure on&#160;<br/>Palestinian communities to leave these areas.<br/>
Additionally, Israeli authorities have imposed severe building restrictions on Palestinians living in the&#160;<br/>Jordan Valley and have carried out extensive demolitions of Palestinian structures that “lack building&#160;<br/>permits”, claiming that the demolitions are simply enforcement of planning and building laws (see&#160;<br/>section 6.1 “Forcible transfer”).<br/>
Finally, Israeli settlers have also used the complex land system in Area C combined with Israel’s severe&#160;<br/>restrictions on Palestinians’ freedom of movement into their agricultural lands to take over uncultivated&#160;<br/>Palestinian land and unregistered land near settlements. Without authorization, some Israeli settlers&#160;<br/>have managed to cultivate such lands for three years consecutively, enabling them to claim them in&#160;<br/>Israeli civil courts.683&#160;According to Kerem Navot, an Israeli human rights organization, between 1997&#160;<br/>and 2012 Israeli settlers took over nearly 24,000 dunams in this way, including 10,000 dunams that&#160;<br/>were privately owned by Palestinians.684<br/>
<b>RESTRICTING ACCESS TO ‘BUFFER ZONE’ AND MARITIME AREAS IN&#160;GAZA STRIP &#160;<br/></b>With some 2 million people inhabiting 365km2, the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated&#160;<br/>areas in the world.685&#160;The problems linked to that density are compounded by increasingly&#160;<br/>restricted access to land and substantial destruction of Palestinian residents’ property as a result of&#160;<br/>discriminatory policies by Israel’s army.<br/>
Historically, Israel established settlements in the Gaza Strip and applied similar discriminatory laws,&#160;<br/>policies and practices to the territory to seize some of the most fertile land from the Palestinian&#160;<br/>

<a name=145></a>population. Between 6% and 12% of land confiscated through military orders in the Gaza Strip was&#160;<br/>allocated to Israeli settlements, fragmenting the geographic continuity of the territory.686&#160;In 2005,&#160;<br/>guided primarily by demographic considerations, Israel withdrew its settlers and ground troops and&#160;<br/>subjected the territory to a land, sea and air blockade, controlling all aspects of Palestinian lives&#160;<br/>within&#160;the territory.&#160;<br/>
While Israel no longer seizes houses and land from Palestinians in Gaza, it uses unlawful lethal force to&#160;<br/>control the “buffer zone”, or access-restricted area located along the fence separating the territory from&#160;<br/>Israel, and the similarly access-restricted maritime area off Gaza’s coast. Israel’s military designated&#160;<br/>the areas as “high risk” and enforces movement restrictions through the use of force, often including&#160;<br/>unnecessary lethal force, when Palestinian civilians, often farmers or protesters, pose no threat to&#160;<br/>life.687&#160;The precise parameters of the “buffer zone” were not declared by Israel, although in 2009 it&#160;<br/>warned against going within 300m of the fence.688&#160;According to human rights organizations, the “buffer&#160;<br/>zone” extends to a distance between 300m and 1,500m from the fence and covers a total of about&#160;<br/>62km2, or roughly 17% of the total area of the Gaza Strip.689&#160;It extends over 35% of the agricultural&#160;<br/>land in Gaza. Meanwhile, the access-restricted maritime area covers 85% of its fishing waters.690&#160;<br/>In 2010, OCHA estimated that Israeli restrictions on access to&#160;land and fishing areas directly affect&#160;<br/>approximately 12% of Gaza’s population.691<br/>
The current Israeli restrictions on land use in the “buffer zone” have been gradually imposed since&#160;<br/>the outbreak of the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;in 2000. Since then, the Israeli military started restricting access to&#160;<br/>agricultural areas near the fence that separates the Gaza Strip and Israel by enforcing a “no go” zone&#160;<br/>near the fence. By mid-2006, Israeli forces had completely levelled the land and demolished all civilian&#160;<br/>homes and structures located between 300m and 600m from the Green Line, forcibly displacing all&#160;<br/>families and communities from this area.692<br/>
Israel claims that it maintains the “buffer zone” to ensure the security of its soldiers and citizens. While&#160;<br/>such security concerns are legitimate and international humanitarian law authorizes Israel as the&#160;<br/>occupying power to prohibit or restrict access to certain areas as a necessary security measure, such&#160;<br/>measures cannot deprive the occupied population of their fundamental rights and must ensure their&#160;<br/>safety and well-being.693&#160;Israel’s enforcement of the “buffer zone” does not meet such requirements&#160;<br/>and often results in violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.<br/>
At the same time, Israel’s use of force in Gaza has seen massive destruction of houses, property,&#160;<br/>infrastructure and large swathes of farmland, in addition to many deaths and serious injuries of&#160;<br/>Palestinian civilians (see section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human development” and section&#160;<br/>6.3 “Unlawful killings and serious injuries”).<br/>

<a name=146></a><b>5.4.4 DISCRIMINATORY URBAN PLANNING AND ZONING SYSTEM&#160;<br/></b>In tandem with the system of land ownership and allocation, planning and zoning policies have been central&#160;<br/>in fulfilling Israel’s policies of establishing Jewish control while marginalizing Palestinian communities in both&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT. Planning has been used to expand the Jewish Israeli presence in strategic locations; build&#160;<br/>Jewish towns, cities and villages; obstruct the geographical expansion of Palestinian towns and centres; and&#160;<br/>regulate land use and Palestinian access to land by zoning it as green areas, industrial zones or military zones.&#160;<br/>
Across Israel and the OPT, Palestinians residing in unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab, East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank are most affected by Israel’s discriminatory planning and zoning&#160;<br/>system, which exposes their houses to a risk of demolition and deprives them of basic services.&#160;<br/>
<b>PLANNING, BUILDING AND HOUSING POLICIES IN ISRAEL &#160;<br/></b>Discriminatory planning, building and housing policies in Israel, which are linked primarily to the state’s&#160;<br/>policy of large-scale confiscation of land and allocation of state land, as outlined above, affect the 1.9&#160;<br/>million non-Jewish citizens of Israel, the vast majority of whom are Palestinian. Restrictive planning and&#160;<br/>building regulations, and discriminatory enforcement of these, make the homes of Palestinians much&#160;<br/>more likely to be demolished. Whereas government policies and planning regulations have curtailed&#160;<br/>the growth and development of Palestinian towns and villages, in the Jewish sector the policy has been&#160;<br/>to expand existing towns and villages and establish hundreds of new villages. As mentioned above,&#160;<br/>about 90% of Palestinian citizens of Israel live in 139 localities that control less than 3% of state land&#160;<br/>in Israel.694&#160;The vast majority of the remaining 10% live in “mixed cities”, including Haifa, Ramla, Lod,&#160;<br/>Jaffa and Acre. By contrast, there are over 1,000 Jewish localities, with large municipal areas, that&#160;<br/>have developed infrastructure and low population density.695<br/>
Since 1948 the state has established more than 700 Jewish localities in Israel, whereas it has not&#160;<br/>established any new locality for Palestinians except for the state-planned Bedouin townships in the&#160;<br/>Negev/Naqab, which are designed for the forced urbanization of Bedouins.696&#160;In fact, nearly 500&#160;<br/>Palestinian localities were destroyed by Israel after 1948, and tens of Palestinian villages that predated&#160;<br/>the state, or to which Palestinians were relocated after 1948, were excluded from the zoning maps and&#160;<br/>are now deemed illegal under Israeli planning laws. As a result, they are routinely subject to demolition&#160;<br/>by the Israeli authorities (see below).697<br/>
In 1965, Israel enacted the Planning and Building Law, which Israeli authorities used to devise&#160;<br/>planning schemes for Palestinian localities in Israel and create tight jurisdictions for their development&#160;<br/>and the expansion of their infrastructure.698&#160;Israeli authorities zoned as non-residential areas most&#160;<br/>of the privately owned Palestinian land that had not been confiscated under different laws. The law&#160;<br/>regulated and centralized all building and land use management under the authority of the Ministry&#160;<br/>of Interior. In 2015, some of this responsibility shifted to the Ministry of Finance.699&#160;Crucially, the&#160;<br/>

<a name=147></a>law established a three-tiered system of planning bodies, at the local, district and national levels,&#160;<br/>each responsible for land use and planning under the different jurisdictions. The law also devised a&#160;<br/>hierarchy whereby the planning starts at the local level, then moves to district level and ends at the&#160;<br/>national level.700&#160;<br/>
The local outline (or master) plan serves as the initial step of development of localities in Israel, by&#160;<br/>setting out the planning policy of the locality through zoning and designation of land use. It is the legal&#160;<br/>basis for issuing building permits and the main tool through which central government enables local&#160;<br/>development. Palestinian localities must rely on relevant Israeli ministries to devise and prepare their&#160;<br/>local outline plans. However, state planners fail to provide adequate plans for Palestinian localities that&#160;<br/>consider the needs of the residents and often take unreasonable time in preparing and updating local&#160;<br/>outline plans for Palestinian localities.701&#160;<br/>
According to a survey conducted by Bimkom – Planners for Planning Rights (Bimkom) and the&#160;<br/>Arab Center for Alternative Planning, two NGOs, of 119 Palestinian localities in Israel at the end of&#160;<br/>December 2011,702&#160;75 had local outline plans initiated between 2000 and 2011 – some of which&#160;<br/>were up to date and others of which were at various stages of approval – while no updated local&#160;<br/>outline plan had been initiated for the remaining 44 localities.703&#160;This means that, prior to 2000,&#160;<br/>none of the Palestinian localities had been granted permission to expand, construction being allowed&#160;<br/>only within the municipal residential boundaries of the locality, despite the fact that the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population had increased 11-fold since the founding of Israel.704&#160;By contrast, for Jewish localities, the&#160;<br/>central government promotes and initiates local development plans with an underlying assumption of&#160;<br/>future expansion, so large land reserves for housing, employment and public lands are zoned for the&#160;<br/>jurisdiction of the locality.705&#160;As a result, it has been possible to re-zone agricultural land not just for&#160;<br/>building houses but also for constructing commercial properties. In addition, over the years, the Israel&#160;<br/>Land Administration and its successor, the Israel land Authority, have readily approved the re-zoning&#160;<br/>of land in kibbutzim (Jewish communities organized as collectives, with communal living and wealth&#160;<br/>held in common, and usually based on agriculture or industry) and moshavim (Jewish agricultural&#160;<br/>communities organized as cooperatives) from agricultural to commercial use.706&#160;<br/>
In the absence of a statutorily approved local outline plan that includes appropriate allocation of land&#160;<br/>zoned for housing, or if a locality is not recognized, all residential construction is prohibited. Thus, it is&#160;<br/>nearly impossible for Palestinians in many localities in Israel to apply for and obtain building permits.707&#160;<br/>This long-standing problem has prompted many Palestinians to build homes without permits, with the&#160;<br/>constant threat that the Israeli authorities will demolish them. According to an estimate by the Mossawa&#160;<br/>Center in 2019, around 50,000 structures were built by Palestinian citizens of Israel without a building&#160;<br/>permit.708&#160;Under the Planning and Building Law of 1965, any building or development without a&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
147<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=148></a>building permit can be “demolished, dismantled or removed” by relevant Israeli authorities, and its&#160;<br/>owner may be liable for the cost of the demolition as well as&#160;a fine and/or imprisonment.709<br/>
Between 2012 and 2014, 97% of administrative demolition orders were issued in what Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities label the Arab sector, comprising mainly Palestinian citizens of Israel, but also the much&#160;<br/>smaller Druze minority. For Palestinian Bedouins in the Negev/Naqab, the buildings of whole&#160;<br/>communities have been repeatedly demolished. At the same time, Israeli courts have retroactively&#160;<br/>approved Jewish communities built without local outline plans and building permits in the same area&#160;<br/>(see box below and section 6.1 “Forcible transfer”).&#160;<br/>
In 2017, Israel passed Amendment 116 to the Planning and Building Law of 1965, known as the&#160;<br/>Kaminitz Law, intended to increase the “enforcement and penalization of planning and building&#160;<br/>offences”,710&#160;especially in the Arab sector. In 2019, then Israeli minister of justice Ayelet Shaked&#160;<br/>revealed the actual intent of the law:<br/>
<i>When we made the Kaminitz Law, the goal was to toughen the enforcement over illegal&#160;<br/>construction mainly in the Arab sector; the authorities enforce the law on Jewish farmers as well…&#160;<br/>I do not want to cancel the law because it led to good results in the Arab sector, but we need to&#160;<br/>see how we can change the law. After all, it is overly onerous toward residents of moshavim.711</i><br/>
One of the main consequences of these various policies is an acute housing shortage for Palestinians&#160;<br/>in Israel. According to estimates by Israel’s State Comptroller in 2015, an ombudsperson reporting&#160;<br/>to the Knesset with the authority to review the policies and operations of government, the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population needed 13,000 new housing units per year.712&#160;However, Adalah reported in 2017 that&#160;<br/>only about 7,000 units were being built, mostly through private construction.713&#160;This leaves an annual&#160;<br/>shortfall of 6,000 housing units in Palestinian localities. Yet, the Israel Land Authority and Ministry&#160;<br/>of Construction and Housing discriminate against Palestinian communities in the allocation of land&#160;<br/>and housing units in favour of Jewish localities and mixed cities. For example, in 2016, the Israel&#160;<br/>Land Authority issued tenders for the construction of 49,903 housing units in Jewish Israeli localities&#160;<br/>(excluding “mixed cities”, which have 5,528 housing units), but only of 4,151 housing units in “Arab&#160;<br/>localities” (6.4% of all new construction tenders).714<br/>
The Negev/Naqab is a prime example of how Israel’s discriminatory planning and building policies&#160;<br/>are designed to maximize land and resources for Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinian land&#160;<br/>and housing rights (see box below). Since the 1970s, regional and local zoning plans have left the&#160;<br/>Palestinian Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab “off the map” such that they are invisible in Israel’s&#160;<br/>development policies. Instead of zoning such villages as residential areas, the Israeli authorities have&#160;<br/>zoned them and the lands around them for military, industrial or public use. Over the years, Israel has&#160;<br/>recognized 11 of these villages but 35 remain “unrecognized” with residents considered to engage&#160;<br/>in “illegal squatting” (see box below). Residents of these villages cannot apply for a building permit&#160;<br/>to legalize their established or new homes as the lands are not designated as residential.715&#160;The lack&#160;<br/>

<a name=149></a>of official status also means that the Israeli authorities do&#160;not provide these villages any essential&#160;<br/>infrastructure or services such as healthcare or education, and residents have no representation in the&#160;<br/>different local governmental bodies as they cannot register for or participate in municipal elections (see&#160;<br/>sections 5.5.3 “Discriminatory provision of services” and 6.1 “Forcible transfer”).717<br/>
The non-recognition of Bedouin villages is related to Israeli policies of concentration and urbanization&#160;<br/>of the Bedouin, and Israel’s denial of Bedouin land rights in the Negev/Naqab.718&#160;In stark contrast,&#160;<br/>Israel views the development of the Negev/Naqab for Jewish communities as “one of the most&#160;<br/>important national tasks”.719&#160;In 2005, the Israeli government adopted the Negev Development Plan&#160;<br/>and established a new ministry tasked with its implementation. The plan aimed to increase the&#160;<br/>Jewish population in the region from 535,000 to 900,000 by 2015. In pursuit of the plan’s goals, law&#160;<br/>enforcement agencies increased house demolitions in unrecognized Bedouin villages and intensified&#160;<br/>legal efforts to take over Bedouin land by declaring it state land.719&#160;The plan also sought to establish&#160;<br/>and promote new Jewish towns and retroactively legalize construction by Jewish citizens, even when&#160;<br/>it did not adhere to planning laws, and include the construction in regional plans.720&#160;Finally, the Israeli&#160;<br/>government appointed several commissions and teams to look into the housing and land questions,&#160;<br/>leading to the drafting of the Law for Regularizing Bedouin Habitation in the Negev, also known as the&#160;<br/>Prawer-Begin Bill, in 2013.&#160;<br/>
The aim of the draft law was to “regularize” the land and housing question, including the 35&#160;<br/>unrecognized Bedouin villages, through the forcible relocation of their population.721&#160;Although the bill&#160;<br/>was shelved, the body that it established to coordinate and implement demolition orders in the Negev/<br/>Naqab continues to operate. The Southern Directorate of Land Law Enforcement, operating under the&#160;<br/>authority of the Ministry of Public Security, deals solely with the enforcement of land and planning laws&#160;<br/>in Bedouin localities, and coordinates the administrative home demolitions with other enforcement&#160;<br/>bodies, including the Israeli police.722<br/>
There are now more than 100 Jewish towns in the Negev/Naqab.723&#160;By contrast, municipal councils of&#160;<br/>Bedouin townships in 2008 had jurisdiction over a mere 1.9% of land in the northern Negev/Naqab&#160;<br/>region, even though the Bedouins comprise over a quarter of the population in the area.724<br/>

<a name=150></a><b>UNRECOGNIZED VILLAGES IN NEGEV/NAQAB &#160; &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
The Negev/Naqab is home to around 250,000 Palestinian Bedouin citizens of Israel.725&#160;They live in three&#160;<br/>types of settlements: 35 unrecognized villages; seven governmental planned townships; and 11 newly&#160;<br/>recognized villages. Tens of thousands of Bedouin in the Negev/Naqab live in homes under demolition&#160;<br/>orders because they cannot obtain building permits. For decades, they have struggled to gain ownership&#160;<br/>and recognition of their villages by Israeli authorities.<br/>
&#160;Unlike other Bedouin communities, the Negev/Naqab Bedouins have for centuries relied largely on&#160;<br/>agriculture alongside pastoralism.726&#160;Prior to the establishment of Israel, over 92,000 Bedouins, who&#160;<br/>are the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, lived in the Negev/Naqab and owned land under a clearly&#160;<br/>defined, traditional system of individual and communal land ownership,727&#160;as well as under applicable&#160;<br/>local state laws.728&#160;Following the establishment of Israel, estimates suggest that between 11,000 and&#160;<br/>18,000 Bedouins remained in Israel.729&#160;Like the rest of the Palestinian citizens of Israel, they gained&#160;<br/>Israeli citizenship. However, Israel declared their ancestral lands as “closed military areas”.<br/>
<b>Land grabs during Israel’s military rule</b><br/>
During the 18-year military rule over Palestinians (1948-1966), starting in 1951 Israel confined 12 of&#160;<br/>the remaining 19 Bedouin tribes in the Negev/Naqab to the Siyag, an area of approximately 1.5 million&#160;<br/>dunams (150,000 hectares) known for its poor fertility, compared to the 13 million dunams controlled&#160;<br/>by the tribes prior to 1948.730&#160;Bedouins were also prohibited from cultivating their land, and isolated&#160;<br/>from other tribes in the Negev/Naqab and the rest of the Palestinian population in Israel.731&#160;They needed&#160;<br/>special permits from the military governor to search for jobs, pursue education or access grazing&#160;<br/>lands. The coercive restrictions resulted in the loss of their traditional way of life and accelerated their&#160;<br/>sedentarization or forced settlement.732&#160;<br/>
Israel utilized the applicable laws to expropriate Palestinian land in the Negev/Naqab, such as the&#160;<br/>Absentees’ Property Law and the Land Acquisition Law, especially Bedouin land outside the Siyag, and&#160;<br/>declared it as state land. Today, the combined area of all the recognized Bedouin villages in the Negev/<br/>Naqab amounts to just 1% of the total area of the Southern District of Israel, even though Bedouins&#160;<br/>represent 35% of the population in the district.733<br/>
<b>Discriminatory zoning and planning</b><br/>
According to the ICBS, approximately half a million Jewish Israelis live in 126 predominantly Jewish&#160;<br/>communities in the Negev/Naqab.734&#160;As of 2016, these communities consisted of 38 kibbutzim, 77&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

<a name=151></a>cooperative and community settlements, and 11 local councils and towns. An overwhelming majority of&#160;<br/>these communities – 115 of the 126 – have “admissions committees” that effectively block the Bedouin&#160;<br/>community and other Palestinian citizens of Israel from residing in them.735&#160;In recent years, Bedouin&#160;<br/>residents have slowly been moving to a handful of local councils and towns that do not have an explicit&#160;<br/>approval process that excludes their residency.<br/>
Israeli authorities zoned Bedouin land, including villages that were established before 1948, as&#160;<br/>agricultural land or for military use, rather than for residential use.736&#160;They also failed to regularize the&#160;<br/>planning status of the 46 Bedouin villages under any regional or municipal structure.&#160;<br/>
Between 1968 and 1990, Israel established seven government-planned townships – Kuseife, Tel&#160;<br/>Sheva, Rahat, Hura, Laqye, Ar’ara Banegev and Segev Shalom – to force the settlement of Bedouin&#160;<br/>and 156,000 Bedouins now reside there. The state’s deliberate neglect of the seven townships&#160;<br/>has resulted in the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the country, high crime rates and&#160;<br/>other socio-economic problems that make them undesirable to the residents of the rural Bedouin&#160;<br/>villages.737&#160;Parts of the seven townships are not connected to the water system, the sewage disposal&#160;<br/>system, the electrical power grid or means of communication.738&#160;At the same time, Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>swiftly connect illegal outposts and individual farms for Jewish citizens to the water and electricity&#160;<br/>grids.739&#160;According to the ICBS, all seven of the planned townships are ranked in the lowest socio-<br/>economic cluster.740&#160;In comparison, every Jewish locality in the Negev/Naqab ranks in a higher&#160;<br/>socio-economic cluster.741<br/>
By 1999, successive Israeli governments had recognized 11 of the 46 Bedouin villages and incorporated&#160;<br/>them into two Bedouin regional councils – Neve Midbar and Qassum (previously Abu Basma).742&#160;These&#160;<br/>villages are home to around 16,000 Bedouins. Although the Israeli authorities recognize these villages,&#160;<br/>they remain excluded from the state’s development plans, making it&#160;difficult for residents to acquire&#160;<br/>building permits or receive state services and infrastructure. Many residents still live with the risk of&#160;<br/>home demolitions because of a lack of building permits.743&#160;Although residents in these recognized&#160;<br/>villages had previous eviction and village demolitions lifted, their circumstances remain extremely&#160;<br/>complicated, similar to those in the unrecognized villages.744<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=152></a>The remaining 35 villages, which are home to around 68,000 people,&#160;remain without an official&#160;<br/>recognized status or planning structure. As a result, it is nearly impossible for residents to acquire&#160;<br/>building permits or obtain housing plans, forcing many to build without permits under the constant&#160;<br/>threat of home demolitions and subsequent forced displacement.745&#160;In 2013, Israel tried to “regularize”&#160;<br/>the situation through the Law for Regularizing Bedouin Habitation in the Negev, also known as the&#160;<br/>Prawer-Begin Bill, which aimed at forced relocation of the villages’ population in the area.746&#160;Although&#160;<br/>the bill was shelved, the body that it established to coordinate and implement demolition orders in the&#160;<br/>Negev/Naqab, the Southern Directorate of Land Law Enforcement, continues to operate.747&#160;Since then,&#160;<br/>Israel has aggressively intensified its use of home demolitions (see section 6.1 “Forcible transfer”).&#160;<br/>
Israeli authorities repeatedly insist that Bedouins in the 35 unrecognized villages can relocate to the&#160;<br/>recognized villages in the Negev/Naqab. Most residents refuse this “voluntary” displacement and&#160;<br/>relocation, especially as it would mean giving up their claim to their land.748<br/>
Alongside the complete denial of any legal rights of land ownership of the Bedouin in the Negev/<br/>Naqab, and as part of its policy to forcibly urbanize the community in enclaves, the Israeli government&#160;<br/>has offered compensation for Bedouin land claims. This approach was first established in 1975 by&#160;<br/>the Albeck Committee, which suggested that the government should go “beyond the letter of the law”&#160;<br/>and offer compensation to the Bedouin claimants on the condition that they agree to move to one of&#160;<br/>the planned townships.749&#160;Since then, the Israeli government’s position has been one of complete legal&#160;<br/>denial, on the one hand, and partial practical recognition of Bedouin land rights through compensation,&#160;<br/>on the other.750&#160;The offer of compensation has been amended several times and framed in different&#160;<br/>resolutions of the Council of the Israel Land Administration (the predecessor of the Israel Land&#160;<br/>Authority), while remaining based on the logic of the Albeck Committee’s compensation scheme.751&#160;<br/>The Bedouin have generally viewed the offers as insufficient and unjust. Accordingly, as of 2008 only&#160;<br/>12% of the original land claims (380 out of 3,220) had been settled, covering an area of 205,670&#160;<br/>dunams (about 18% of the total claimed lands).752&#160;Government attempts have continued in parallel to&#160;<br/>resolve this matter by appointing other committees that have produced further recommendations.753&#160;<br/>

<a name=153></a>Most significant was the Goldberg Committee, which was appointed&#160;in 2007. Its recommendations&#160;<br/>were later incorporated with several changes into the proposed Prawer-Begin Bill.754&#160;The state-offered&#160;<br/>alternatives for the Bedouin are displacement and forced urbanization, denial of legal land rights, and&#160;<br/>alternative lands that were deemed back in 1975 to be unjust and insufficient. Since 1975, the Bedouin&#160;<br/>community has grown about eightfold and the proposed compensation remains nearly the same.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, new Jewish Israeli communities have been established following a push to Judaize the&#160;<br/>Negev/Naqab.755&#160;Plans for these new towns and cities are advanced by Israeli authorities, including the&#160;<br/>Ministry for Development of the Negev and Galilee756&#160;and the Ministry of Construction and Housing.757&#160;<br/>The Settlement Division of the WZO serves as the government’s arm for planning and implementing the&#160;<br/>settlement of these communities.758&#160;Jewish Israeli groups such as the OR Movement, a group dedicated&#160;<br/>to expanding Jewish settlement in the Negev/Naqab and Galilee, also plays a coordinating role, working&#160;<br/>closely with Israeli authorities (including 11 ministers) to develop new Jewish communities.759&#160;Between&#160;<br/>2002 and 2021, the OR Movement developed eight new communities and expanded 63 others in the&#160;<br/>Negev/Naqab and Galilee.760<br/>
<b>Discriminatory home demolitions and forced evictions</b><br/>
Israeli authorities have enforced home demolitions, forced evictions and other punitive measures&#160;<br/>disproportionately against Bedouins as compared with Jewish Israelis not conforming to planning laws&#160;<br/>in the Negev/Naqab.761&#160;Most unlicensed Jewish buildings and farms built without outlined plans and&#160;<br/>building permits are retroactively approved or never face a demolition order.762&#160;Israeli courts have helped&#160;<br/>entrench this discrimination through retroactively approving dozens of Jewish Israeli communities&#160;<br/>and farms, contrary to the same planning laws that result in the demolition of Bedouin homes.763&#160;For&#160;<br/>example, in 2016 the Beersheba Magistrates’ Court ruled in favour of an Jewish Israeli citizen for&#160;<br/>unlawful construction of guest rooms for a hospitality business in the illegally constructed Jewish village&#160;<br/>of Azuz in the Ramat Negev Regional Council. The defendant argued that selective law enforcement was&#160;<br/>taking place as planning and construction enforcement does not apply to the residents of Azuz, using&#160;<br/>the argument that the entire village was built without permits. The court accepted that the Ramat Negev&#160;<br/>Regional Council does not enforce planning and construction laws against Jews while it does against&#160;<br/>Bedouins in the same district.764&#160;An investigation by the National Unit for Building Inspection in the&#160;<br/>

<a name=154></a>Southern District revealed that enforcement of the planning and building laws targets Bedouin citizens&#160;<br/>only.765&#160;The court’s dismissal of the case served as de facto approval of the state’s discrimination against&#160;<br/>the Bedouin.<br/>
<b>Forcible transfer under the guise of social and economic development</b><br/>
On 12 February 2017, Israel’s cabinet approved Government Resolution 2397, a five-year Socio-<br/>Economic Development Plan for Negev Bedouin,766&#160;and allocated it NIS 3 billion (USD 968 million). The&#160;<br/>plan was developed under the Authority for the Development and Settlement of the Bedouin (Bedouin&#160;<br/>Authority), which is a unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The Bedouin Authority&#160;<br/>was originally established in 1999 to settle Bedouin land claims and regularize “permanent dwellings”&#160;<br/>for the Bedouin community in the Negev/Naqab.767&#160;Over the years, however, the Bedouin Authority&#160;<br/>became the main government body responsible for several Bedouin-related issues, including planning,&#160;<br/>land agreements, water allocation and health services.768&#160;The Bedouin Authority has been criticized as&#160;<br/>a discriminatory body complicit in the forcible displacement of Bedouins from their homes in order to&#160;<br/>Judaize the Negev/Naqab.769<br/>
The Bedouin Authority is promoting the Socio-Economic Development Plan for Negev Bedouins as&#160;<br/>a genuine effort to improve life for Bedouins in the Negev/Naqab. However, the plan conditions the&#160;<br/>provision of state funding on the execution of forced evictions and home demolitions, including in the&#160;<br/>35 unrecognized Bedouin villages that are excluded from the benefits of the plan.770&#160;Several government&#160;<br/>ministers refused to even approve the draft plan until additional measures to ensure the destruction&#160;<br/>of the unrecognized villages were included.771&#160;The plan fails to offer any way for recognition of the&#160;<br/>unrecognized villages, and it mandates the Bedouin Authority to prioritize evacuating the Bedouin&#160;<br/>communities living in the unrecognized villages.<br/>
In addition, pressure has increased on Bedouin communities by enforcement agencies working to&#160;<br/>advance the plan. For example, according to the Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality, “this&#160;<br/>mechanism of ‘enforcement promoting regulation’ is exercised through judicial injunctions; imposition&#160;<br/>of high fines (up to NIS 300,000); the constant presence of inspectors and police forces in the field;&#160;<br/>threats; and the use of drones.”772&#160;It is also important to note that the Bedouin Authority is primarily run&#160;<br/>by people from outside the Bedouin community. According to the website of the Bedouin Authority, 13&#160;<br/>of the 14 members holding executive positions are Jewish Israelis. Only one member comes from the&#160;<br/>Bedouin community.773<br/>
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) criticized the plan,&#160;<br/>noting that it was “accompanied by forced urbanization, evictions and displacements and the State party&#160;<br/>

In January 2019, the Bedouin Authority published the Strategic Plan for the Regulation of the Negev,&#160;<br/>which seeks to forcibly transfer 36,000 Bedouins for the purpose of expanding military training areas&#160;<br/>and to create “economic development projects”.775&#160;The plan is scheduled to be implemented over&#160;<br/>several years and has been criticized by UN human rights experts.776&#160;Israel’s Southern District Planning&#160;<br/>and Building Committee has taken the plan forward and convened to discuss the establishment of&#160;<br/>camps to temporarily house the tens of thousands of Bedouin citizens of Israel who are meant to be&#160;<br/>forcibly displaced.777<br/>
<b>PLANNING, BUILDING AND HOUSING POLICIES IN EAST JERUSALEM&#160;<br/></b>In East Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities have also utilized their zoning and planning laws and practices&#160;<br/>to further Jewish domination over Palestinians. On the one&#160;hand, Israel has confiscated a third of the&#160;<br/>land in annexed East Jerusalem for Israeli settlements. On the other, its planning, building and housing&#160;<br/>policies have precluded expansion of Palestinian neighbourhoods and communities by zoning most&#160;<br/>of their land as green spaces such as nature reserves and parks, and restricting the expansion of&#160;<br/>existing Palestinian neighbourhoods. Zoning and planning policies systematically discriminate against&#160;<br/>Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem and severely impede the development of their neighbourhoods,&#160;<br/>with dire impacts on the socio-economic rights of the local population.&#160;<br/>
Since the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1967, planning for Palestinian neighbourhoods in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem has been focused on maintaining a Jewish Israeli majority in the “united city”, a policy&#160;<br/>reflected in official documents and statements by Israeli policymakers.778&#160;Although the Planning and&#160;<br/>Building Law of 1965 (see above) required the preparation of a plan for a locality within three years,779&#160;&#160;<br/>Israeli planners failed to do this for East Jerusalem, leaving Palestinian neighbourhoods there without a&#160;<br/>local outline (or master) plan.780&#160;A local outline plan sets out the policy for use of the land for purposes&#160;<br/>such as residence, industry and green space, and serves as the legal basis for granting building&#160;<br/>permits.781&#160;A local outline plan can only be prepared by an official governmental authority under the&#160;<br/>Planning and Building Law of 1965.782&#160;As explained above, the lack of an up-to-date local outline plan&#160;<br/>can lead to unregulated building and subsequent demolitions.783<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=156></a>In August 2004, a national planning committee introduced the “Jerusalem 2000” local outline plan.&#160;<br/>The plan is considered to be key to shaping Israeli planning policies in East Jerusalem. Even though&#160;<br/>the plan has not been deposited for public review and is thus non-binding or a basis to issue building&#160;<br/>permits, the Jerusalem Municipality has stated that it does “constitute the planning policy in the&#160;<br/>city”.784&#160;The planning authorities have already used it to reject at least two Palestinian zoning plans,&#160;<br/>maintaining that they are not consistent with the “Jerusalem 2000” plan.785&#160;Israeli rights groups have&#160;<br/>concluded that the plan violates Israeli law and bypasses the statutory procedure of the planning&#160;<br/>regime.786&#160;In 2013, Bimkom petitioned the Jerusalem administrative court against the unlawful use of&#160;<br/>the plan, but its case was dismissed.787<br/>
The “Jerusalem 2000” plan is the first to include East and West Jerusalem in a single plan.788&#160;It&#160;<br/>provides that municipal planning in Jerusalem should seek to “maintain a ratio of 70% Jews and&#160;<br/>30% Arabs” in the city in accordance with “governmental decisions”. Noting that “demographic&#160;<br/>trends” indicated “a population of approximately 60% Jews and 40% Arabs” in Jerusalem in 2020,&#160;<br/>the plan proposes to “draw residents from other areas in the country” and “reduce negative migration&#160;<br/>from the city” in order to maintain a “solid Jewish majority in the city”.789&#160;It will do this by providing&#160;<br/>“sufficient housing” (more houses) in existing neighbourhoods, building new Jewish neighbourhoods,&#160;<br/>subsidizing housing units to lower housing costs, and ensuring “the quantity and quality of a number&#160;<br/>of employment places, services, quality of life, and urban experiences”.790&#160;The plan acknowledges&#160;<br/>that the “Arab population suffers from housing problems due to&#160;the significant size of the population&#160;<br/>and lack of financial resources”. In response to this, the plan&#160;recommends the “densification and&#160;<br/>thickening” of existing neighbourhoods, “rehabilitation of the refugee camps within its borders” and&#160;<br/>building residential areas for “wealthy Arab households”.791&#160;<br/>
In East Jerusalem today, Palestinians comprise 60% of the population but only 15% of the land is&#160;<br/>designated by the Israeli planning authorities for Palestinian residence, with 2.6% of this land zoned for&#160;<br/>public buildings.792&#160;By contrast, since 1967 the Israeli authorities have permitted and actively enabled&#160;<br/>settlements, built illegally on land expropriated for the exclusive use of Jewish Israelis, to be established&#160;<br/>and expanded in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>
The deliberate refusal to approve zoning plans for the development of Palestinian neighbourhoods&#160;<br/>in East Jerusalem has had a ruinous effect on Palestinian communities, making it difficult for them&#160;<br/>to obtain building permits. According to data from Peace Now, from 1991 to 2018, Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>approved applications for 9,536 building permits for Palestinians in East Jerusalem (16.5% of the&#160;<br/>57,737 applications for building permits approved in Jerusalem), compared to 21,834 applications&#160;<br/>

<a name=157></a>for permits for settlements in East Jerusalem (37.8%).793&#160;The remaining 26,367 applications for&#160;<br/>permits were approved in West Jerusalem. Peace Now also noted that the average number of housing&#160;<br/>units approved in Israeli neighbourhoods in both East and West Jerusalem was 10.5 units per&#160;<br/>permit, compared to 3.5 units per permit in Palestinian neighbourhoods.794&#160;This reality forces many&#160;<br/>Palestinians to build without permits and therefore risk having their homes demolished (see section 6.1&#160;<br/>“Forcible transfer”).795<br/>
The inadequate planning in Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem hinders the development&#160;<br/>of the community as a whole, including the construction of public spaces, schools and commercial&#160;<br/>zones for employment opportunities.796&#160;Palestinians live in underdeveloped and densely populated&#160;<br/>areas in East Jerusalem where the average size of a Palestinian household is six, compared to just&#160;<br/>over three people per Jewish Israeli household in Jerusalem.797&#160;The consequence is grinding poverty&#160;<br/>for Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem (see section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human&#160;<br/>development”).&#160;<br/>
The Israeli fence/wall is another major obstacle to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and its environs, as&#160;<br/>it cuts through the city and isolates it from the rest of the West Bank. By the time Israel completed&#160;<br/>the fence/wall in Jerusalem in 2016, its route had diverged from the municipal boundaries annexed&#160;<br/>in 1967 to carve out enclaves that were detached from the city and resulted in their severe neglect&#160;<br/>by Israeli authorities.798&#160;It has left the Palestinian neighbourhoods of Shuafat refugee camp, Anata&#160;<br/>(comprising the three adjacent neighbourhoods of Ras Khamis, Ras Shehadeh and Al-Salaam) and&#160;<br/>Kufr Aqab, within the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem, but beyond the fence/wall. Around 100,000&#160;<br/>Palestinians with permanent Jerusalem residency live in these locations, and they must now pass&#160;<br/>through Israeli checkpoints every time they need to enter the rest of the city or receive essential&#160;<br/>services.799&#160;Israeli authorities deliberately neglect these neighbourhoods and do not provide them with&#160;<br/>municipal services, including waste removal, road maintenance, education and adequate connection&#160;<br/>to water, electricity and sewerage infrastructure. In 2017, Israeli members of the Knesset tried to pass&#160;<br/>a bill to split the areas that are detached from Jerusalem’s boundaries by the fence/wall from the rest of&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and place them under a different municipal body in an attempt to alter the demographic ratio&#160;<br/>in Jerusalem.800&#160;The “Greater Jerusalem” Bill (known in Hebrew as “Jerusalem and its daughters”) was&#160;<br/>struck off the parliamentary agenda on 29 October 2017 due to international pressure.801<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
157<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=158></a>remained under full Israeli control since 1967. As already mentioned, Area C is home to around&#160;<br/>300,000 Palestinians in addition to almost all of the 441,600 Israeli settlers living in the occupied West&#160;<br/>Bank excluding East Jerusalem. However, Israeli authorities have allocated 70% of the land in Area C&#160;<br/>to settlements and less than 1% to Palestinians.802&#160;In practice, Palestinians are only allowed to build on&#160;<br/>about 0.5% (roughly 1,800 hectares) of Area C, most of which is already built-up.803<br/>
Like many other aspects of Palestinian life in the West Bank, zoning and planning in Area C is&#160;<br/>subject to a combination of selectively applied Ottoman, British and Jordanian laws amended by&#160;<br/>a series of Israeli military orders issued since 1967 to advance Israeli territorial and demographic&#160;<br/>objectives in the area. Adopted in 1971, Military Order 418 deprived Palestinians from any decision-<br/>making in the planning of their development and land use by cancelling local planning committees&#160;<br/>in Palestinian villages and transferring licensing powers from Palestinian municipalities to regional&#160;<br/>planning committees and the Civil Administration’s Higher Planning Council, a body made up of&#160;<br/>Israeli government officials and settler representatives.804&#160;Under the military order, the council is&#160;<br/>empowered to cancel or change any plan or licence at any time, as well as to authorize people to build&#160;<br/>without obtaining a permit. In parallel, the order authorized the military commander to appoint Special&#160;<br/>Planning Committees for new planning areas provided that they did not include “the jurisdiction of a&#160;<br/>municipality or a village council” and, as a result, excluded Palestinian communities.805&#160;By contrast,&#160;<br/>such committees were appointed for all municipal authorities (local and regional councils) in Israeli&#160;<br/>settlements in the West Bank given that they were all built in new planning areas. Amongst other&#160;<br/>things, these committees are empowered to prepare planning schemes based on which they can&#160;<br/>issue building permits – a right which is denied to Palestinian villages in the same area.806&#160;Indeed,&#160;<br/>the Civil Administration’s planning system does not allow for any Palestinian representation or&#160;<br/>meaningful participation and, as a result, does not take account of the Palestinian population’s needs,&#160;<br/>demographic and economic interests, or traditions, while consistently privileging the interests of settlers&#160;<br/>at the same time.&#160;<br/>
Further, the Israeli authorities use a selective interpretation of Jordanian law to insist that planning&#160;<br/>must conform with British mandate outline plans that were drafted in the 1940s and that have never&#160;<br/>been updated since, making any “legal” construction virtually impossible. Indeed, the British mandate-<br/>era plans no longer reflect the needs of the Palestinian population in the West Bank or modern-day&#160;<br/>planning, and include areas where construction permits have been exhausted. Crucially, they have&#160;<br/>never been reviewed even though, under Jordanian law, planning authorities must review such plans&#160;<br/>at least once every 10 years. Rather than enabling Palestinian development, these plans “serve as an&#160;<br/>effective tool for limiting Palestinian construction, demolishing homes and blocking development”, as&#160;<br/>B’Tselem has argued.807&#160;<br/>
The Israeli Civil Administration has also avoided approving local outline (or master) plans of Palestinian&#160;<br/>communities in Area C, where 90% of Palestinian communities remained without any outline plan in&#160;<br/>2013.808&#160;Indeed, the Israeli Civil Administration routinely rejects applications for building permits on&#160;<br/>the basis that they do not match British outline plans, forcing Palestinians to build without permits,&#160;<br/>which are needed for all basic and livelihood structures, such as a tent or a fence, and exposing them&#160;<br/>to a risk of demolitions. The Israeli Civil Administration approved just 21 of the 1,485 Palestinian&#160;<br/>

<a name=159></a>applications for building permits in Area C between 2016 and 2018.809&#160;In a rare move, in July 2019,&#160;<br/>the Israeli Security Cabinet vowed to grant building permits to 715 housing units for Palestinians in&#160;<br/>Area C, in addition to 6,000 housing units for settlers there.810&#160;By the end of June 2020, only one&#160;<br/>building permit had been issued for Palestinians, allowing for the construction of six housing units.811&#160;<br/>Meanwhile, 1,094 building permits were issued for Jewish settlements from July 2019 to March 2020.812&#160;&#160;<br/>
The dire situation in the villages of Umm al-Khair and Khirbet Susiya in the South Hebron Hills in&#160;<br/>Area C of the West Bank illustrates the impact of Israel’s discriminatory planning, zoning and building&#160;<br/>policies on Palestinians’ rights to adequate housing, adequate standard of living and water.&#160;<br/>
<b>VILLAGES FACING REPEATED DEMOLITIONS IN THE SOUTH HEBRON HILLS &#160; &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
<b>Umm Al-Khair</b><br/>
Umm Al-Khair is a Palestinian village in the South Hebron Hills that is inhabited by people from the&#160;<br/>Al-Hathaleen tribe, who were displaced from Tel Arad in the Negev/Naqab in 1948 during the 1947-49&#160;<br/>conflict. Following their expulsion, they bought the land of Umm Al-Khair from Palestinian residents of&#160;<br/>Yatta. Umm Al-Khair has a population of approximately 200 people, including around 50 children. Most&#160;<br/>of the residents are shepherds.&#160;<br/>
The village has 151 structures with pending demolition orders from Israeli authorities.813&#160;Nearly every&#160;<br/>building has already been demolished at least once and rebuilt by residents. According to OCHA, since&#160;<br/>January 2009 (as of 12 June 2021), Israeli authorities had demolished 40 structures, 29 of which are&#160;<br/>homes, resulting in the displacement of 155 people.<br/>
The adjacent Israeli settlement of Carmel, which was established in 1981 and now has approximately&#160;<br/>437 settlers, lies on land confiscated from residents of Umm Al-Khair. Some sections of the settlement&#160;<br/>are within 100m of Umm Al-Khair. Unlike the settlement of Carmel, which was swiftly provided with&#160;<br/>modern infrastructure, the village of Umm Al-Khair is not connected to any infrastructure networks and&#160;<br/>is denied permits to build any. Israeli settlers from Carmel persistently harass, and sometimes attack,&#160;<br/>residents of Umm Al-Khair, often while they are in the field with their livestock.814&#160;<br/>
&#160;Residents of Umm Al-Khair must purchase water through private Palestinian companies, which deliver&#160;<br/>water to the community. Residents pay around NIS 30 (USD 10) per cubic metre of water, as well as&#160;<br/>a transportation fee of NIS 150 (USD 48).815&#160;Some families pay up to NIS 400 (USD 129) per day to&#160;<br/>provide water for their families and livestock.816&#160;Residents use solar panels for electricity, many of them&#160;<br/>given to the community by the German government through a humanitarian project. The solar panels&#160;<br/>often fail to provide enough electricity for families to adequately heat their homes in the winter.<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=160></a>In 2016, in an effort to stop the ongoing demolitions and seek a way to develop the infrastructure of&#160;<br/>their community, residents of Umm Al-Khair submitted a local outline (or master) plan to the Israeli Civil&#160;<br/>Administration. As a result, on 19 December 2016 the Israeli Supreme Court froze pending demolition&#160;<br/>orders for three years. In June 2019, Israeli authorities rejected the plan, stating that the community had&#160;<br/>constructed infrastructure without building permits. The same month the community submitted another&#160;<br/>local outline plan to the Israeli Civil Administration, thus freezing the pending demolition orders for a&#160;<br/>further three years.<br/>
Eid Hathaleen, an artist and activist from the community, told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>For a long time, communities living in the South Hebron Hills were looking for a way to stop or&#160;<br/>freeze the ongoing demolitions. We know that Israelis [authorities] will never greenlight any master&#160;<br/>plan we submit, we do it just to buy more time before the next demolition. It is inevitable. It will&#160;<br/>take a long time until we can live a life without apartheid, and we are positive we will continue&#160;<br/>to suffer more in the near future. It has taken so long for the world to see our reality. Until the&#160;<br/>USA and the international community stop supporting Israeli apartheid, the demolitions will not&#160;<br/>stop. The massive support from governments around the world makes what is not normal seem&#160;<br/>normal.817&#160;&#160;</i><br/>
Tariq Hathaleen, an English teacher and activist from the community, told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>We know that the confiscations and demolitions are being done to stop the ability of Palestinians&#160;<br/>in the village to develop and build, even though this is our land. Some families have demolition&#160;<br/>orders on their homes or barns from over 11 years ago.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>On top of the demolition orders, we also face settler harassment. Settler harassment means we&#160;<br/>suffer constantly, in between the demolitions we are never free from psychological violence. Since&#160;<br/>2016 it has come from the settlers living in Carmel as well as by the Israeli settler organization&#160;<br/>Regavim. They fly drones over our community two maybe three times a week just to survey us.&#160;<br/>Instead of the settlers sending Israeli soldiers to terrorize us, they send over a drone. We are now&#160;<br/>always under surveillance.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>We live a life of inequality, and all we want is a life with justice. It is simple really. Life should be&#160;<br/>filled with peace and quiet not fear and terror. Life without apartheid would just be a more normal&#160;<br/>life, that is all that we want.818</i><br/>
<b>Khirbet Susiya</b><br/>
The Palestinian village of Khirbet Susiya is home to around 250 people, who have traditionally earned&#160;<br/>a living from shepherding and olive trees.819&#160;In 1983, the Israeli settlement of Susya, which currently&#160;<br/>has a population of 1,170 settlers, was established near the village on private Palestinian land that&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities declared to be state land.820&#160;In 1986, when about 25 families were living on their&#160;<br/>private land in ancient Khirbet Susiya, the Israeli Civil Administration declared the village’s land an&#160;<br/>“archaeological site” and the land was confiscated “for public purposes”. As a result, the Israeli military&#160;<br/>expelled Palestinian residents from their homes. Having no other option, the families moved to what&#160;<br/>remained of their land outside the archaeological site, about 500m from their village. They received no&#160;<br/>

In 1991, the Israeli military forced them from that&#160;<br/>location, later claiming it was to enforce Israeli planning and building laws in the area.&#160;<br/>
The Palestinian villagers relocated again to where the village currently stands, and live in tents and&#160;<br/>temporary shelters. Israeli authorities have issued demolition orders against all 170 structures in the&#160;<br/>village, which include 32 residential tents and shacks, 26 animal shelters, 66 family utility structures, 20&#160;<br/>cisterns, 20 latrine units, two clinics, a school and a kindergarten. Approximately half of these structures&#160;<br/>have been funded by international donors and provided as humanitarian assistance.821&#160;<br/>
Palestinian residents have repeatedly tried to obtain building permits, but Israeli authorities have refused&#160;<br/>to issue them and instead, in 1999, 2001 and 2011, demolished many of the Palestinians’ new shelters.&#160;<br/>In 2012, the Israeli Civil Administration issued demolition orders for over 50 structures in Khirbet Susiya.&#160;<br/>The orders stated that they were renewals of demolition orders originally issued in the 1990s on grounds&#160;<br/>of lack of building permits. The residents therefore live with the constant fear that their homes will be&#160;<br/>demolished.822&#160;<br/>
They have been fighting a legal battle for years to prevent this from happening.823&#160;A petition by the&#160;<br/>Palestinian residents against the demolition orders was filed at the Supreme Court of Israel in February&#160;<br/>2014 and, as of the end of August 2021, was still pending.824&#160;The Supreme Court refused to issue an&#160;<br/>interim injunction freezing demolitions until a ruling on the case, as it normally does in such cases.&#160;<br/>Palestinians therefore live with the constant fear that their homes will be demolished.825&#160;They have been&#160;<br/>fighting a legal battle for years to prevent this from happening.826&#160;In February 2018, the Supreme Court&#160;<br/>decided that the state could immediately demolish seven other structures, which served 42 people –&#160;<br/>about half of them children.827<br/>
Israeli authorities continue to block water cisterns and wells serving the village, severely impacting the&#160;<br/>Palestinian residents’ right to access safe, affordable water.828&#160;Israel has refused to connect the village&#160;<br/>to the water and sewerage system and electricity networks. Residents are forced to pay for water to be&#160;<br/>trucked in from a nearby Palestinian town. In 2015, the UN estimated that about a third of villagers’&#160;<br/>income was spent paying for water.829&#160;This situation constitutes a breach of Israel’s obligation to provide&#160;<br/>an affordable supply of water and puts at risk the realization of other human rights, such as the right to&#160;<br/>an adequate standard of living and food.830&#160;&#160;<br/>
By contrast, the nearby Susya settlement has been granted a generous local outline plan that allows&#160;<br/>Israeli settlers to develop housing and infrastructure.831&#160;Susya settlement is also connected to the&#160;<br/>electricity, water and sewerage networks, and has a municipal swimming pool.

The loss of land has forced the Palestinian village to cut back the size of its herds. Azam Nawaj’a said he&#160;<br/>used to have 150 sheep, but now can only manage to look after 25. He also told Amnesty International&#160;<br/>that settlers often come to destroy the village’s olive trees. He said that three years earlier they had cut&#160;<br/>down 300 of his olive trees.833&#160;According to OCHA, Israeli settlers vandalized and damaged 800 olive&#160;<br/>trees and saplings in Khirbet Susiya in 2014 alone.834&#160;<br/>
Restrictions on access to land have also impacted access to water. Fatima Nawaj’a, a resident of Khirbet&#160;<br/>Susiya, told Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>We used to depend on the wells we build and rain-fed water, but they [settlers and Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities] have kept either taking over our sources of water or destroying them, rendering them&#160;<br/>unusable. Some of us were able to rebuild our destroyed wells, but they were smaller in size, and&#160;<br/>so the only way to get water was through rainwater. When we run out of this form of water we have&#160;<br/>to buy water. We buy five litres of water for NIS 35. Keep in mind that we are&#160;going through all of&#160;<br/>this while the settlers living on our land have zero restraints on access to water, or anything else for&#160;<br/>that matter: electricity, healthcare, education and work opportunities.835&#160;</i><br/>

<b>5.5 DEPRIVATION OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS&#160;<br/></b>Israel’s fragmentation, segregation and land confiscation policies and practices described above have&#160;<br/>left Palestinians marginalized, impoverished and subject to widespread and systematic socio-economic&#160;<br/>disadvantage across all domains of control. Decades of discriminatory treatment and allocation of resources&#160;<br/>by Israeli authorities for the benefit of Jewish Israeli citizens in Israel&#160;and Israeli settlers in the OPT have&#160;<br/>compounded the inequalities on the ground. Overall, Palestinians across all domains of control are denied&#160;<br/>the same opportunities to earn a living, engage in business and support themselves and their families as&#160;<br/>Jewish Israelis. Instead, they experience discriminatory limitations on access to and use of farmland, water,&#160;<br/>gas and oil, amongst other natural resources, as well as restrictions on the provision of health, education and&#160;<br/>other essential services.&#160;<br/>
This section focuses on Israeli policies aimed at suppressing Palestinians’ human development, the&#160;<br/>discriminatory allocation of natural and economic resources for the socio-economic development of&#160;<br/>Jewish Israelis and the discriminatory provision of services to Palestinians across Israel and the OPT with a&#160;<br/>particular focus on the rights to access to water, to healthcare and to education as emblematic examples.&#160;<br/>
<b>5.5.1 SUPPRESSION OF PALESTINIANS’ HUMAN DEVELOPMENT<br/></b>Palestinians living in Israel and the OPT are unambiguously disadvantaged across all well-being indicators&#160;<br/>for which measures are available. Their lack of enjoyment of a range of economic and social rights is a direct&#160;<br/>result not only of their segregation from Jewish Israelis but also from each other through severe restrictions&#160;<br/>on movement, and the subjugation of Palestinian human development to the socio-economic interests of&#160;<br/>Jewish Israelis.&#160;<br/>

<a name=165></a>Israel has designed policies to maintain Jewish domination over the Palestinian economy through the&#160;<br/>exclusion of Palestinian communities inside Israel, and the creation of a regime of economic dependency in&#160;<br/>the OPT in the context of a prolonged military occupation. This has prevented Palestinians from achieving&#160;<br/>sustainable development in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.837&#160;<br/>
At the same time, Israel has sought to mask this reality. In its 2019 review of Israel, CERD criticized the lack&#160;<br/>of comprehensive, updated statistics on the socio-economic status of the different population groups living&#160;<br/>in Israel and in the territories under its jurisdiction or effective control. It recommended that it provide such&#160;<br/>statistics disaggregated by, amongst other factors, ethnic or national origin and languages spoken.838&#160;CERD&#160;<br/>further criticized Israel for not including information on the socio-economic status of the population living&#160;<br/>in the OPT, noting that Israel bears obligations as set out in the ICERD and international law towards the&#160;<br/>population of the OPT.839&#160;&#160;<br/>
<b>SEGREGATED PALESTINIAN ECONOMY INSIDE ISRAEL&#160;<br/></b>Israel’s long-standing discriminatory policies towards its Palestinian citizens have not only impeded&#160;<br/>their socio-economic development but also resulted in a large gap between them and their Jewish&#160;<br/>Israeli counterparts, in terms of standard of living, livelihood opportunities, education, welfare,&#160;<br/>healthcare and cultural services.840&#160;These gaps have been created by successive Israeli governments&#160;<br/>over more than seven decades through policies and practices which have aimed, on the one hand,&#160;<br/>to restrict Palestinians’ access to the labour market in order to protect Jewish Israelis’ preferential&#160;<br/>access to employment and, on the other, to make Palestinians dependent on economic opportunities&#160;<br/>provided by the state and the Jewish sector by intentionally hampering the development of Palestinian&#160;<br/>communities and their economy.841&#160;The resulting subordination of the Palestinian economy&#160;<br/>“further reinforced the socio-economic inequality between the two population groups”842&#160;with some&#160;<br/>researchers arguing that it was an integral part of Israeli state-building “aimed at controlling the&#160;<br/>[Palestinian] minority”.843<br/>
Historically, Israel adopted socio-economic policies towards its Palestinian citizens that are similar&#160;<br/>to those it pursues towards Palestinians in the OPT today, such as using them, at different times,&#160;<br/>as a source of cheap labour in order to preserve the interests of the Jewish majority. As explained&#160;<br/>above, during the period of military rule in Israel (1948-1966), Palestinians inside the Green Line&#160;<br/>were subjected to tight restrictions on movement primarily designed to expropriate land. Heavily&#160;<br/>reliant on agriculture for their livelihoods until 1948 and without access to farmland, Palestinians&#160;<br/>were forced to seek economic opportunities in the Jewish sector. Their access to work, however,&#160;<br/>depended on obtaining work permits, a system established to protect Jewish citizens’ jobs at a time&#160;<br/>of unemployment caused by rapid immigration and economic problems. Restrictions were gradually&#160;<br/>

These goals relate to, amongst others, ending poverty, ending hunger and achieving food security, ensuring healthy lives and promoting&#160;<br/>
well-being for all, ensuring availability and sustainable management of water for all, reducing inequality within and among countries,&#160;<br/>
making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe and sustainable and ensuring quality education for all. For more information, see UN&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=166></a>eased as Israel experienced huge economic growth prompting the need for an increased labour force&#160;<br/>mainly in the construction sector.844<br/>
Palestinian citizens of Israel were eventually incorporated into the labour market and, following&#160;<br/>the 1967 occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, replaced by Palestinians from the OPT to&#160;<br/>perform the majority of the most insecure and lowest paid jobs. However, inequalities persisted&#160;<br/>and became more entrenched as Israel created jobs for its Palestinian citizens in the sectors it was&#160;<br/>keen to develop for the benefit of its Jewish population whilst&#160;simultaneously pursuing a strategy of&#160;<br/>neglect and underdevelopment of Palestinian localities. Over the years, in addition to massive land&#160;<br/>seizures, the following policies have had a particularly detrimental effect on Palestinian communities&#160;<br/>in Israel: the exclusion of Palestinian localities from high priority areas for development; discriminatory&#160;<br/>allocation of land and water for agriculture; discriminatory planning and zoning, and the delegation&#160;<br/>of major infrastructure development projects to Israeli state institutions involved in the expropriation&#160;<br/>of Palestinian land such as the WZO and the Jewish Agency for Israel, resulting in the prioritization&#160;<br/>of infrastructure projects in Jewish localities, while failing to put in place a similar mechanism in&#160;<br/>Palestinian communities (see sections 5.5.2 “Discriminatory allocation of resources” and 5.5.3&#160;<br/>“Discriminatory provision of services” for more details).845&#160; &#160;<br/>
As a result of these policies Palestinian communities in Israel are segregated from Jewish localities&#160;<br/>and lack the infrastructure required for economic development, forcing their population to seek&#160;<br/>employment in the Jewish sector, where they then face institutional discrimination when competing for&#160;<br/>jobs, particularly those with higher status.846<br/>
In noting that average measures alone do not give a complete picture of well-being conditions847&#160;<br/>and that assessing well-being outcomes at the country level requires taking into account differences&#160;<br/>between people and population groups, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development&#160;<br/>(OECD) highlighted that Arab populations848&#160;living in Israel are clearly disadvantaged across all well-<br/>being dimensions for which measures are available.849&#160;They experience higher rates of poverty,&#160;<br/>and lower levels of labour force participation, educational attainment and health. These multiple&#160;<br/>disadvantages are likely to be mutually reinforcing with, for example, low educational attainment&#160;<br/>leading to unfavourable labour market outcomes.&#160;<br/>
One key indicator of this well-being gap is the poverty rate among Palestinian citizens of Israel, which is&#160;<br/>amongst the highest in Israel. In 2020, 23% of Israeli citizens lived under the poverty line,850&#160;compared&#160;<br/>to 35.8% of Palestinian citizens of Israel.851<br/>

<a name=167></a>A 2018 socio-economic survey by the ICBS showed that the proportion of individuals who describe&#160;<br/>themselves as poor is 3.5 times higher among Arab residents (27.6%) compared to Jewish residents&#160;<br/>(7.6%). (The vast majority of those described as “Arabs” are Palestinians; see section 5.2.1&#160;<br/>“Palestinians in Israel”.) The same survey found that the average monthly net income per household in&#160;<br/>the Arab sector is NIS 12,700 (USD 4,097), compared to NIS 18,720 (USD 6,051) in the Jewish sector&#160;<br/>in Israel.852&#160;The poverty rate among Arab households with young children is 63%, compared to 32.3%&#160;<br/>in the whole population.853&#160;<br/>
As described above, Bedouin residents of the unrecognized villages in the Negev/Naqab are amongst&#160;<br/>the most marginalized populations in Israel (see section 5.4.4 “Discriminatory urban planning and&#160;<br/>zoning regime”). They live in extreme poverty and have the lowest education levels and incomes,&#160;<br/>alongside the highest infant mortality and unemployment rates, in the country.854&#160;In its 2019 review,&#160;<br/>the CESCR expressed concern “about the high and growing incidence of poverty” in Israel, including&#160;<br/>among Palestinian citizens of Israel, who include Bedouins. It also noted the high level of income&#160;<br/>inequality, which is the highest of the 37 member states of the OECD.855&#160;That same year, CERD&#160;<br/>expressed concern that non-Jewish minority groups, in particular Palestinian communities, continued&#160;<br/>to face limitations in the enjoyment of their right to work and were concentrated in low-paying sectors.&#160;<br/>It called on Israel to “[i]ntensify its efforts to increase the labour market participation of non-Jewish&#160;<br/>minority groups, in particular Palestinians and Bedouins, especially women belonging to these&#160;<br/>communities, including by providing education and training tailored to their experience and level of&#160;<br/>job skills and by considering the establishment of special measures.”856&#160;This was also reflected in the&#160;<br/>CESCR’s 2019 review when it expressed concern that certain groups such as “Bedouins” and “Arab&#160;<br/>women” continued to be limited in the enjoyment of their right to work and were concentrated in low-<br/>paid sectors.857<br/>
More broadly, Palestinian citizens’ access to the labour market in Israel remains limited even though&#160;<br/>educational attainment outcomes have improved for both Palestinian men and women in recent&#160;<br/>years.858&#160;The gap for Palestinian women is particularly significant as,&#160;although more have joined the&#160;<br/>formal workforce over recent decades, their participation rate remained low at 34% in 2018, and&#160;<br/>was only half of the equivalent employment rate of Jewish Israeli women (estimated at 68% in 2018).&#160;<br/>Meanwhile, according to ICBS data, in 2018, some 65% of Palestinian men were formally employed,&#160;<br/>but the majority (60%) worked in lower-status and lower-skill jobs compared to 27% of Jewish Israelis&#160;<br/>performing such jobs.859&#160;The confinement of Palestinians to poorly resourced enclaves,&#160;institutional&#160;<br/>discrimination and “outright prejudice against Palestinians” are amongst the key reasons behind these&#160;<br/>socio-economic gaps between Palestinian and Jewish Israelis.860<br/>

<a name=168></a><b>FRAGILE AND SUBJUGATED ECONOMY IN OPT&#160;<br/></b>Across the OPT, Israel’s discriminatory policies of territorial fragmentation and segregation pursued in&#160;<br/>the context of a prolonged military occupation have had a hugely detrimental effect on the performance&#160;<br/>of the Palestinian economy, leaving it disconnected, weak and subordinate to Israel’s geo-demographic&#160;<br/>goals, and crucially, unable to achieve sustainable and equitable development for the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population. Whilst the situation in the OPT has improved over recent decades with regards to some&#160;<br/>social rights, including maternal health, literacy and vaccination rates, in general, living standards have&#160;<br/>been stagnating or deteriorating with access to healthcare, employment, education and housing being&#160;<br/>particularly affected.861&#160;&#160;<br/>
Since 1999, Palestinian gross domestic product (GDP) in the OPT has effectively remained stagnant&#160;<br/>clearly pointing to the “suppression of human potential” and economic growth resulting from Israel’s&#160;<br/>oppression and domination of Palestinians.862&#160;In 2019, GDP growth in the West Bank was 1.15%,&#160;<br/>down from 2.3% in 2018, the lowest rate since 2012.863&#160;The Palestinian economy suffers from&#160;<br/>numerous restrictions by Israel on trade that impact on the production of exports and importable&#160;<br/>goods. Almost all Palestinian imports and exports transit ports and crossing points controlled by Israel,&#160;<br/>where delays and security measures increase costs by an average of USD 538 per shipment, resulting&#160;<br/>in a significant and persistent trade deficit. In 2019, the trade deficit was 33.7% of GDP.864<br/>
<b>DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF ‘DUAL USE’ POLICY ON ECONOMY OF WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
Israel’s restrictions on movement in the OPT are not limited to people, but also control the movement&#160;<br/>of goods into and out of the territories. Israel imposed a “dual use” policy in 2007 that restricts the&#160;<br/>entry of any goods it deems to potentially have military, as well as civilian, use, including chemicals&#160;<br/>and technology. This policy only applies to Palestinian importers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,&#160;<br/>not to their Israeli counterparts or even to Israeli settlers in the OPT. It has been devastating for&#160;<br/>Palestinians and their small economy in general, especially for the agriculture, information and&#160;<br/>communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing sectors, and has had catastrophic effects in the&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip in particular.865&#160;<br/>
Since 2007, Israel has progressively expanded the list of products and goods liable under the “dual use”&#160;<br/>policy so that it now comprises 117 items.866&#160;The “List of Dual-Use Goods requiring Approval for Entry&#160;<br/>into the Gaza Strip and Judea and Samaria Area” was published for the first time in 2017 following a legal&#160;<br/>battle, according to Israeli human rights organization Gisha – Legal Center for Freedom of Movement&#160;<br/>(Gisha).867&#160;It includes a general list of 56 items for the totality of the OPT, and an additional 61 items&#160;<br/>specifically for Gaza, which goes well beyond standard international practice, according to the World&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=169></a>Bank.868&#160;Relaxing the “dual use” list would lead to an additional, cumulative GDP growth of 6% to the West&#160;<br/>Bank economy and about 11% in Gaza by 2025, according to a 2019 analysis by the World&#160;Bank.869<br/>
The list is vague, including categories such as “communications equipment, communication support&#160;<br/>equipment, or equipment with communication functions”. These categories can include items that&#160;<br/>are found in everyday use, such as home appliances and medical equipment.870&#160;Further, authorization&#160;<br/>of access to the items requires going through a permit process administered by the Israeli Civil&#160;<br/>Administration, but final approval is granted by the Israel Security Agency.871<br/>
Israel controls all aspects of exporting from the Gaza Strip, including the types of goods that can be&#160;<br/>exported, where they can be exported to and when they can leave the territory. Between 2007 and&#160;<br/>2014, Israel only allowed goods from Gaza to be exported abroad and not to Israel or the rest of the&#160;<br/>OPT.872&#160;Since late 2014, Israel has permitted a limited list of agricultural and manufactured goods to&#160;<br/>be sold in the West Bank (such as textiles) and Israel (such as eggplants and tomatoes).873&#160;There is no&#160;<br/>security rationale for Israel’s punitive restrictions on exports from Gaza,874&#160;which have resulted in dire&#160;<br/>economic conditions and violated the human rights of the civilian population.&#160;<br/>
Between 1 January and 31 October 2020, on average 7,056 trucks per month entered Gaza compared&#160;<br/>to 10,400 trucks per month in 2005, before Israel significantly restricted the transfer of goods into the&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip.875<br/>
In April 2019, the World Bank called on Israel to reform and ease the cumbersome “dual use” policy&#160;<br/>to align with international standards outlined in various international legal instruments and developed&#160;<br/>by relevant international organizations.876&#160;It stated that it had resulted in “severe fiscal shock” on the&#160;<br/>Palestinian economy and living standards of Palestinians in the OPT.877<br/>
The 1994 Paris Protocol entrenched the dependence of the Palestinian economy on Israel via a&#160;<br/>customs union that leaves no space for independent Palestinian economic policies, tying the OPT to&#160;<br/>the trade policies, tariff structure and value-added tax rate of Israel. Moreover, Israel collects trade&#160;<br/>tax revenues on behalf of the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and then transfers them to the&#160;<br/>Palestinian authorities. This allows Israel to control two thirds of Palestinian tax revenue and entails&#160;<br/>the leakage of Palestinian fiscal resources to the treasury of Israel, estimated at hundreds of millions&#160;<br/>of US dollars per year. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) partially estimates&#160;<br/>the Palestinian fiscal leakage, from six main sources, to be&#160;equivalent to 3.7% of Palestinian GDP or&#160;<br/>17.8% of total tax revenue. Between 2000 and 2017, the Palestinian fiscal leakage was estimated to&#160;<br/>be USD 5.6 billion, or 39% of GDP in 2017.878&#160;<br/>

<a name=170></a>In addition, every year Palestinians from the OPT lose substantial financial resources in income tax&#160;<br/>and social security payments made by Palestinians working in Israel, without benefiting from any&#160;<br/>corresponding public expenditure on services that would serve their communities.879<br/>
<b>‘DE-DEVELOPMENT’ IN GAZA STRIP UNDER ISRAEL’S ILLEGAL BLOCKADE<br/></b>The blockade and Israel’s repeated military offensives have had a heavy toll on Gaza’s essential&#160;<br/>infrastructure and further debilitated its health system and economy. Indeed, Israel’s collective&#160;<br/>punishment in Gaza of the civilian population, the majority of whom are children, has created&#160;<br/>conditions inimical to human life due to shortages of housing, potable water and electricity, and&#160;<br/>lack of access to essential medicines and medical care, food, educational equipment and building&#160;<br/>materials.880&#160;In its 2019 conclusions, CERD expressed concern that the long-standing blockade of&#160;<br/>the Gaza Strip violates the right to freedom of movement and impedes the ability to access essential&#160;<br/>services, especially healthcare.881&#160;&#160;<br/>
According to UNCTAD, between 2007 and 2018, due to the Israeli blockade, the economy grew by&#160;<br/>less than 5% and its share of the Palestinian economy decreased from 31% to 18%. As a result, GDP&#160;<br/>per capita shrank by 27% and more than 1 million people were pushed below the poverty line, with the&#160;<br/>rate of poverty increasing from 40% in 2007 to 56% in 2017.882&#160;The proportion of people surveyed in&#160;<br/>Gaza who said they found it difficult or very difficult to live&#160;on their current income increased from 63%&#160;<br/>in 2011 to 74% in 2016.883<br/>
The World Bank concluded that, by 2018, Gaza had effectively been reduced to a safety-net state, with&#160;<br/>over 75% of its households relying on some form of social assistance. It further stated that this reality,&#160;<br/>combined with a nearly universal lack of access to reliable water and electricity services and restrictions&#160;<br/>on access to medical services outside the region, was widely recognized as a humanitarian crisis.884<br/>
This entrenched the dependence of more than 80% of the population on international assistance.&#160;<br/>However, UNCTAD also noted that such assistance has been insufficient to prevent deep crises of&#160;<br/>poverty, food insecurity, hygiene and health, as well as electricity shortages and a dearth of safe&#160;<br/>drinking water.885&#160;By 2019, GDP growth was virtually at zero, with the territory failing to rebound from&#160;<br/>two consecutive contractions: minus 7.7% in 2017 and minus 3.5% in 2018. Therefore, the real GDP&#160;<br/>per capita declined by 2.8%.886&#160;The unemployment rate in Gaza was 45.1% in 2019.887<br/>
According to UNCTAD, between 2007 and 2018 the estimated cumulative economic cost of Israel’s&#160;<br/>occupation in Gaza amounted to USD 16.7 billion – six times the value of Gaza’s GDP in 2018.888&#160;The&#160;<br/>poverty rate increased from 40% to 56% between 2007 and 2017.889<br/>

Much of the&#160;<br/>available food is provided by the UN and other aid agencies or smuggled in through tunnels running&#160;<br/>under the Egypt-Gaza border and then sold on at exorbitantly high prices to Gaza’s beleaguered&#160;<br/>residents.890&#160;Israeli authorities have severely restricted the entry of goods into Gaza and have been&#160;<br/>using “mathematical formulas” to determine the entry of food “essential for the survival of the civilian&#160;<br/>population”.891&#160;&#160;<br/>
In 2018, OCHA reported a 68% prevalence of food insecurity in Gaza,892&#160;even though most households&#160;<br/>in Gaza reported that they received some form of food assistance or social transfers from Palestinian&#160;<br/>governmental bodies or international organizations.893&#160;According to UNRWA, before the blockade&#160;<br/>began in June 2007, 80,000 Palestinian refugees in Gaza received urgent food aid. In 2019, that figure&#160;<br/>was over 1 million.894&#160;Further, a 2019 nutrition needs assessment in Gaza found that 18% of pregnant&#160;<br/>women and 14% of lactating mothers were malnourished and only 14% of children under five years of&#160;<br/>age had a minimum acceptable diet.895&#160;<br/>
The collapse of Gaza’s economy caused by the blockade has been exacerbated by four Israeli&#160;<br/>military offensives in the past 13 years, which have caused huge destruction to civilian property&#160;<br/>and infrastructure in addition to killing at least 2,700 Palestinian civilians as well as injuring and&#160;<br/>displacing tens of thousands of others. During this period&#160;Palestinian armed groups fired thousands of&#160;<br/>indiscriminate rockets towards cities and towns in Israel killing or injuring dozens of civilians. In 2019,&#160;<br/>UNCTAD estimated the cost of the three Israeli military operations in Gaza between 2008 and 2014 to&#160;<br/>be at least three times the GDP of Gaza.896&#160;&#160;<br/>
<b>DESTRUCTION OF GAZA’S INFRASTRUCTURE &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
Between 2000 and 2005, at least 2,500 homes were destroyed along the “buffer zone” outside the&#160;<br/>context of military offensives.897&#160;Israel’s four major military operations in Gaza between 2008 and&#160;<br/>2021, carried out within the context of the illegal blockade devastated civilian housing and essential&#160;<br/>infrastructure, including electricity, water and sewerage and sanitation plants.898&#160;&#160;<br/>

<a name=172></a>Approximately 60,000 homes and other properties were damaged or destroyed during these military&#160;<br/>offensives.899&#160;Only a small proportion of properties destroyed in the conflicts between 2008 and 2014 were&#160;<br/>reconstructed before the 2021 military offensive. For example, Israeli air strikes destroyed or damaged&#160;<br/>around 17,800 homes in the 2014 assault on Gaza and, by 2019, around a fifth of the homes destroyed&#160;<br/>were still either destroyed or heavily damaged, leaving more than 100,000 Palestinians homeless in the&#160;<br/>largest displacement in the OPT since 1967.900&#160;In 2019, UNCTAD estimated the cost of the three Israeli&#160;<br/>military operations in Gaza between 2008 and 2014 to be at least three times the GDP of Gaza.901<br/>
Prior to the 2014 Israeli attacks there was a shortage of at least 75,000 housing units in Gaza, largely as&#160;<br/>a result of building stoppages caused by restricted imports. Even when materials are allowed into Gaza,&#160;<br/>increased shipping, storage and compensation costs raise prices and make construction unaffordable&#160;<br/>for many. Additionally, blocked access to Gaza of staff and contractors delays or stops building and&#160;<br/>infrastructure projects.902<br/>
Between 2006 and 2017, there were 297 incidents in which Israeli forces targeted water, energy and&#160;<br/>agriculture infrastructure in Gaza, usually during military offensives.903&#160;During the 10-21 May 2021&#160;<br/>offensive, Israeli army attacks wrought massive destruction on Gaza’s infrastructure yet again, which the&#160;<br/>ICRC said will take years to rebuild.904&#160;&#160;<br/>
Israel’s military offensives against the Gaza Strip have also undermined Gazans’ access to education.&#160;<br/>For example, of the seven schools destroyed during Israel’s 2014 offensive, only one had been rebuilt&#160;<br/>by August 2016.905&#160;While damaged schools have been repaired, even prior to 2014 there was a shortage&#160;<br/>of over 200 schools in Gaza. This has resulted in severe overcrowding in most of Gaza’s schools,&#160;<br/>many of which function on a double shift basis – hosting one school in the morning and another in the&#160;<br/>afternoon.906&#160;The impact of the May 2021 offensive resulted in 331 damaged educational facilities.907&#160;<br/>
Since 2007, Israel has in general refused to allow into Gaza much of the construction materials needed&#160;<br/>to rebuild civilian infrastructure such as cement and wooden planks under the Israeli military’s “dual&#160;<br/>

start of the escalation until 12pm on 21 May 2021, 1,042 housing and commercial units were destroyed; another 769 units were severely&#160;<br/>
damaged and rendered uninhabitable; and a further 14,536 units suffered minor damage. The Education Cluster (of UN and Palestinian&#160;<br/>
institutions) reported that 53 education facilities had been damaged since the start of the escalation. According to the Health&#160;Cluster (of&#160;<br/>
UN and Palestinian institutions), as of 21 May 2021, six hospitals and 11 primary healthcare centres had been damaged, with one centre&#160;<br/>
suffering severe damage. One hospital was not functioning due to lack of electricity. See OCHA, “Escalation in the Gaza Strip,&#160;the West&#160;<br/>

In 2019, some 80% of cement needed for housing&#160;<br/>reconstruction was imported through the GRM.909<br/>
In August 2020, Israel imposed a three-week punitive ban on the entry of construction materials and&#160;<br/>fuel for Gaza’s power plant, which reduced Gaza’s power supply and impaired the health, water and&#160;<br/>sanitation systems.910<br/>
After the ceasefire that ended the May 2021 conflict, the international community pledged to rebuild&#160;<br/>Gaza. The US government promised a serious effort to be coordinated with the Palestinian authorities&#160;<br/>in Ramallah that should not benefit the Hamas de facto administration&#160;in Gaza. Despite this, the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities have maintained a strict closure of the crossings into and out of Gaza, severely restricting the&#160;<br/>movement of people and goods.911&#160;The UN had launched reconstruction efforts by October 2021.912&#160;<br/>

A 2019 study by the Applied Research Institute – Jerusalem concluded&#160;<br/>that closures substantially reduce the probability of being employed, hourly wages and the number of&#160;<br/>days worked, while at the same time increasing the number of working hours per day. The study also&#160;<br/>concluded that checkpoints alone cost the West Bank economy at least 6% of GDP and that placing&#160;<br/>a checkpoint one minute away from a locality reduces the probability of being employed by 0.41%,&#160;<br/>the hourly wage by 6.3% and the working day by 2.6%.915&#160;At the same time, in 2017, the World&#160;<br/>Bank estimated that the removal of all Israeli restrictions on Area C alone could bring about additional&#160;<br/>cumulative growth of 33% for the West Bank economy by 2025.916&#160;<br/>
According to the World Bank, the Palestinian agriculture sector’s productivity has declined because of&#160;<br/>Israeli restrictions on accessing water and agricultural land in Area C, and the “dual use” policy that&#160;<br/>includes key agricultural production items.917&#160;For instance, the restrictions on imported fertilizers have&#160;<br/>created a range of problems for the Palestinian agricultural sector, such as low productivity and soil&#160;<br/>degradation. In 2015, UNCTAD estimated that agricultural productivity in the OPT had declined by&#160;<br/>20-30% since the enforcement of importation restrictions on fertilizers.918&#160;While the ICT sector is one&#160;<br/>of the fastest growing sectors in the OPT, according to the Palestinian Investment Promotion Agency,919&#160;<br/>the Palestinian ICT sector continues to be forcibly integrated into the Israeli system and also faces&#160;<br/>severe limitations as a result of this dependency and other Israeli restrictions on the sector, including&#160;<br/>the “dual use” restrictions on the transfer of ICT equipment.920&#160;According to the World Bank, the sector&#160;<br/>has only grown from 0.1% of GDP in 1994 to 4% in 2019.921&#160;The World Bank also reported that the&#160;<br/>capacity of the manufacturing sector in the OPT had stagnated as a result of the multi-layered system&#160;<br/>of Israeli restrictions, including the “dual use” policy, resulting in the decline of the share of the sector&#160;<br/>in the Palestinian economy.922&#160;While the manufacturing sector contributed 19% of the Palestinian GDP&#160;<br/>in 1994, this had dropped to around 10% by 2019, according to the World Bank.923&#160;<br/>
The situation of the OPT as a reservoir of cheap labour for Israel and Israeli settlements constrains&#160;<br/>the further development of the Palestinian economy. For example, the furniture sector has been&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>

<a name=176></a>significantly inhibited by the continuous flow of skilled workers&#160;to competitors in Israel that can afford&#160;<br/>to pay higher wages.924&#160;According to UNCTAD, in 2019 nearly 10% of the workforce, comprising&#160;<br/>133,000 Palestinians, in the West Bank were employed in Israel and settlements.925&#160;While a study cited&#160;<br/>by UNCTAD found that Palestinians working in Israel and settlements increased factor income (income&#160;<br/>derived from factors of production such as land, capital and labour) received from Israel, it said that&#160;<br/>this “also decreases labour supply to the domestic market, dampens incentives to invest in human&#160;<br/>capital and negatively affects GDP growth.”926<br/>
<b>ECONOMY IN LIMBO IN EAST JERUSALEM<br/></b>Systematic restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, including the&#160;<br/>fence/wall and the presence of Israeli settlements that segregate and isolate East Jerusalem from the&#160;<br/>rest of the West Bank (and Gaza Strip) are also a key obstacle to East Jerusalemites’ ability to access&#160;<br/>livelihood opportunities, and drastically hinder their political, economic, cultural and social lives.&#160;<br/>
On the one hand, the economy of East Jerusalem remains dependent on the West Bank for services&#160;<br/>and for the production and trading of goods, but, on the other, it is also dependent on Israeli regulatory&#160;<br/>systems, and subordinated to its demographic imperatives and settlement strategies. As a result, it is&#160;<br/>not integrated in either system, and finds itself in a “developmental limbo”.927&#160;By physically separating&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, since the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;the Israeli authorities have&#160;<br/>considerably reduced the city’s role “as the mercantile and trading centre for the West Bank”.928&#160;&#160;<br/>According to UNCTAD, between 1993 and 2013, the Palestinian economy in East Jerusalem had&#160;<br/>shrunk by approximately 50%, while the fence/wall caused over USD 1 billion of direct losses to&#160;<br/>Palestinians in East Jerusalem in the first 10 years since the start of its construction mainly through lost&#160;<br/>trade and employment opportunities.929<br/>
For East Jerusalem’s merchants and other businesses, Israel’s permit regime and restrictions on&#160;<br/>movement have meant limited travel of worshippers for Friday prayers in Al-Aqsa mosque in the&#160;<br/>Old City or for work and education and a resulting loss of clients. By 2009, 25% of East Jerusalem’s&#160;<br/>businesses were forced to shut down due to the closure system. At the same time, job opportunities&#160;<br/>in East Jerusalem have remained limited because of, among other things, Israel’s land grabs and&#160;<br/>discriminatory planning and building procedures preventing any Palestinian-led activity in the&#160;<br/>construction sector, in addition to a rapidly growing labour force.930&#160;<br/>
At the same time, Israel’s discriminatory policies relating to land use, planning and housing and&#160;<br/>residency rights, which are aimed at hampering the natural growth of the city’s Palestinian population,&#160;<br/>have contributed to high poverty rates amongst Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Indeed, every year,&#160;<br/>Palestinians in East Jerusalem lose between NIS 630 million (USD 203 million)931&#160;and NIS 1.4 billion&#160;<br/>(USD 452 million) – approximately NIS 80,000 (USD 25,806) per family – because they cannot prove&#160;<br/>

Today, some 72% of Palestinian families live below the poverty line, compared to 26% of&#160;<br/>Jewish Israeli families in the city, pointing to the systematic exclusion of Palestinians from the Israeli&#160;<br/>state despite East Jerusalem’s annexation. The picture is even bleaker when it comes to children. As of&#160;<br/>2019, 81% of Palestinian children in Jerusalem (most of them residing in East Jerusalem) lived below&#160;<br/>the poverty line, compared to 38% of Jewish children in Jerusalem.933<br/>
Employment statistics reflect similar patterns of inequality to&#160;those of Palestinian citizens of Israel,&#160;<br/>with higher labour participation rates among Jerusalem’s Jewish residents (77% in 2019) than&#160;<br/>among its Palestinian population (50%).934&#160;While more Palestinian men from East Jerusalem were in&#160;<br/>active employment in 2019 than Jewish men residing in the city (72% versus 78 %) this is mainly&#160;<br/>due to low levels of employment amongst Jewish ultra-orthodox men, many of whom opt to study&#160;<br/>in yeshivas instead of working. In addition, the majority of Palestinian men from East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>tend to work in low paid, lower skill jobs in the construction, transportation and storage services,&#160;<br/>accommodation and food services sectors and trade. By contrast, the vast majority of Jewish men&#160;<br/>work in higher skill jobs in education, local and public administration, professional and scientific&#160;<br/>services, trade and human health and social services.935&#160;This inequality is even greater when it comes&#160;<br/>to Palestinian women, of whom only 23% were formally employed in 2019 compared to 81% of Jewish&#160;<br/>women living in Jerusalem. According to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, the low level of&#160;<br/>workforce participation among Palestinian women is primarily due to lower levels of education, the&#160;<br/>non-recognition of Palestinian academic degrees by Israeli employers in the city, limited Hebrew and&#160;<br/>English language skills and lack of childcare support in East Jerusalem.936<br/>
<b>IMPACT OF ISRAEL’S DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES ON HEALTH OF PALESTINIANS IN OPT<br/></b>Israel’s occupation and fragmentation of the OPT has detrimentally impacted the enjoyment by&#160;<br/>Palestinians of their right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,937&#160;including&#160;<br/>the underlying determinants necessary for the enjoyment of good health and well-being.938&#160;In this&#160;<br/>respect, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the following:&#160;<br/>
<i>The underlying conditions of life needed for enjoyment of good health and wellbeing by&#160;<br/>Palestinians are… detrimentally affected by the situation of ongoing military occupation of the&#160;<br/>West Bank and Gaza Strip… In addition to death and injury, exposure to violence has longer-<br/>term implications for physical and mental health, with Palestinian adolescents having one of the&#160;<br/>highest burdens of mental disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.939&#160;</i><br/>

<a name=178></a>Data collected in 2013 indicated that about 54% of Gaza’s children had post-traumatic stress disorder&#160;<br/>as a result of Israeli military attacks and the blockade.940&#160;A 2017 study indicated that the OPT had the&#160;<br/>largest burden of mental disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.941<br/>
The lack of adequate healthcare services for Palestinians, primarily resulting from Israel’s prolonged&#160;<br/>occupation, has resulted in lower life expectancy and higher infant and maternal mortality rates&#160;<br/>in comparison to Israeli settlers residing in the West Bank. In 2019, life expectancy at birth for&#160;<br/>Palestinians in the OPT was 74 years;942&#160;infant mortality was 17 per 1,000 live births;943&#160;and maternal&#160;<br/>mortality was reported to be 27 deaths per 100,000 live births.944&#160;By comparison, in the same year&#160;<br/>Israeli settlers had a life expectancy of nearly 83 years;945&#160;an infant mortality rate of 3 deaths per 1,000&#160;<br/>live births;946&#160;and a maternal mortality rate of three deaths per 100,000 live births.947<br/>
<b>5.5.2 DISCRIMINATORY ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES&#160;<br/></b>Policies guiding the allocation of resources in Israel, other than those relating to land, as evidenced in the&#160;<br/>patterns of discriminatory distribution of public resources to localities, have also heavily favoured Jewish&#160;<br/>Israelis. Meanwhile, these policies deny Palestinian citizens of Israel equal access to resources necessary for&#160;<br/>the enjoyment of their social and economic rights.&#160;<br/>
The situation is even more acute in the OPT, where Israeli authorities have systematically and unlawfully&#160;<br/>appropriated Palestinians’ natural resources for the economic benefit of their own citizens in Israel and in the&#160;<br/>settlements, in violation of international law.948&#160;Israel’s exploitation of Palestinian natural resources of fertile&#160;<br/>agricultural land, water, oil, gas, stone and Dead Sea minerals deprives Palestinians of equal access to, or&#160;<br/>the opportunity to administer, develop and benefit from their own resources. This severely impinges on their&#160;<br/>access to livelihoods and socio-economic rights, such as the rights to food and an adequate standard of&#160;<br/>living. In addition, Israeli policies of exclusion, segregation and restrictions on movement prevent Palestinians&#160;<br/>from accessing the resources that they are in theory able to exploit, and that are essential for their livelihood.<br/>
<b>UNEQUAL ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES IN ISRAEL<br/></b>The income inequality between Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jewish Israelis is reflected in the lack of&#160;<br/>equal expenditure on public services. According to the ICBS, there were 255 local authorities in Israel in&#160;<br/>2018, of which there were 77 municipalities, 124 local councils and 54 regional councils.949&#160;About 90% of&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel live in 139 localities, of which 112 are under the jurisdiction of 77 Palestinian&#160;<br/>local councils, 25 under regional Jewish authorities, and two are part of Jewish local councils.950&#160;The&#160;<br/>remaining 10% live in “mixed cities” under the jurisdiction of their respective municipalities.<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=179></a>Historically, the exclusion of Palestinian localities from national development projects and the lack of&#160;<br/>authorized zoning plans have been the major obstacles to economic development for Palestinians in Israel.&#160;<br/>Without such zoning plans, Palestinian communities have been unable to designate land for housing&#160;<br/>and industrial use or establish the infrastructure needed for economic development.951&#160;Today, only 2% of&#160;<br/>industrial zones in Israel, which generate a significant tax income, are located within Palestinian localities,&#160;<br/>which are poorly connected to other parts of Israel by public transportation or main roads.952&#160;&#160;<br/>
Local authorities in Israel provide “local services, such as water supply, sewage systems, garbage disposal,&#160;<br/>road paving and maintenance, installation and maintenance of public gardens and parks, social services,&#160;<br/>and establishment of institutions for sports, education, culture and health”. Central government remains&#160;<br/>responsible for “education, health, welfare and religious services”.953&#160;The income of the local authorities&#160;<br/>comes from the local taxes paid by its residents and budget transferred from the central government.954&#160;<br/>Local authorities with limited resources rely on government subsidies to ensure they can continue to provide&#160;<br/>services. A 2014 report by the rights groups Sikkuy and Injaz found that, while local taxes make up 66% of&#160;<br/>the revenue for localities across Israel, they constitute only 31% of the budget for Palestinian localities.955&#160;&#160;<br/>Palestinian local authorities collect less tax revenue, largely because of the disparity in income from non-<br/>residential or business taxes – the consequence of discriminatory Israeli policies described throughout this&#160;<br/>report. Palestinian localities also receive lower subsidies from the central government intended for specific&#160;<br/>expenditures, such as education, welfare, health and cultural services. The subsidies received fail to meet&#160;<br/>the reasonable and essential needs of the Palestinian localities,956&#160;and are lower than those received by&#160;<br/>Jewish localities in Israel and even lower than those received by Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.957<br/>
According to the 2018 ICBS survey, monthly public expenditure on education and culture in the Jewish&#160;<br/>sector (NIS 3,612 per capita) is nearly three times more than in the Arab sector (NIS 1,250 per capita).&#160;<br/>The monthly expenditure on housing in the Jewish sector (NIS 4,234 per capita) is nearly 1.5 times higher&#160;<br/>than in the Arab sector (NIS 2,937 per capita).958&#160;The discrimination in the agriculture sector is also striking:&#160;<br/>in 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development allocated only 1% of its budget to the Arab&#160;<br/>sector while transferring grants to Jewish farmers, according to the Mossawa Center.959&#160;Current policies&#160;<br/>compound decades of discrimination in the sector, widening the socio-economic gap between Palestinian&#160;<br/>and Jewish citizens. In 1981 for example, 81.15% of farmland was located on state land owned by both the&#160;<br/>Israeli state and the JNF/KKL. Of this, only 0.17% was allocated to Palestinian farmers. Similarly, the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities have discriminated against Palestinians when allocating water for farming and irrigation.960&#160;In a&#160;<br/>more recent example, in April 2020 the Israeli government allocated an economic recovery budget of NIS&#160;<br/>2.8 billion to local authorities amid the Covid-19 pandemic, of which only NIS 47 million or roughly 1.7% of&#160;<br/>the budget was transferred to Palestinian local authorities in Israel, despite Palestinians making up 19% of&#160;<br/>

<a name=180></a>the population and being one of the largest groups living in poverty.961&#160;Palestinian local authorities protested&#160;<br/>this discriminatory allocation, arguing that a funding total of NIS 70 million per month was needed to enable&#160;<br/>Palestinian local councils to deal with the effects of the pandemic.962<br/>
In 2015, Israel decided to allocate about NIS 12.3 billion (USD 3.97&#160;billion) over five years for Arab&#160;<br/>local authorities in Israel, known as the Economic Development Plan for the Arab Sector 2016-2020 or&#160;<br/>Government Resolution 922. This was focused on closing the gaps in planning and housing, employment,&#160;<br/>transportation and education in Arab society.963&#160;The Mossawa Center commented that, while the resolution&#160;<br/>was a step in the right direction, it scarcely began to narrow or even address the gaps between the Arab&#160;<br/>community and the Jewish majority in Israel accumulated over years of unequal resource allocation.964&#160;<br/>Indeed, in the early 1960s, Israel allocated merely 0.2% of its national budget for development in Arab&#160;<br/>localities, rising to 1.3% in the 1970s despite the fact that Arabs constituted well over 10% of Israel’s total&#160;<br/>population at the time. This underfunding has continued since then pointing to a long-standing pattern of&#160;<br/>institutional discrimination.965&#160;The Mossawa Center further noted that it was difficult to discern the degree&#160;<br/>to which the Israeli government fulfilled its commitments in the resolution and that the government only&#160;<br/>transferred a fraction of the promised budget between 2016 and 2018.&#160;<br/>
On 4 and 5 November 2021 the Knesset approved the state budget proposed by the coalition government.966&#160;<br/>These votes marked the first state budget approved since March 2018 and provided for investment in public&#160;<br/>utilities and infrastructures, for welfare, economic and trade reform, and for planning in all state sectors.&#160;<br/>The budget amounted to NIS 609 billion (USD 196 billion) for 2021 and NIS 573 billion (USD 185 billion)&#160;<br/>for 2022. The budget included NIS 26.5 billion (USD 8.5 billion) for&#160;a five-year plan until 2026 aimed at&#160;<br/>the socio-economic development of Arab communities. It also included NIS 2.5 billion shekels (USD 806&#160;<br/>million) for a national plan to combat crime and violence in those communities, including for the hiring&#160;<br/>of 1,100 police officers to patrol streets. The plan also promises the creation of a new Bedouin city in the&#160;<br/>Negev/Naqab and the recognition of three Bedouin villages.967&#160;The next step for the approved budget will be&#160;<br/>the breakdown of expenditure in specific areas, with decisions expected from individual ministries in early&#160;<br/>2022. For instance, the 2021-22 education budget does not specify how much of the budget for building&#160;<br/>new classrooms and repair of school buildings will go to schools in Palestinian and other Arab localities in&#160;<br/>Israel where the medium of instruction is Arabic.968&#160;The planned investment is significant and welcome, but&#160;<br/>the outcome will only be clear once there is implementation of a plan to reverse decades of discrimination,&#160;<br/>rather than to plan development from unequal starting points.<br/>

<a name=181></a>and exports.969&#160;Following the occupation, Israel’s various policies – including building settlements and&#160;<br/>the fence/wall, and severe restrictions on Palestinians’ movement and ability to access their land – have&#160;<br/>deprived Palestinians and their economy of 63% of the most fertile and best grazing land in the West Bank,&#160;<br/>located in Area C.970&#160;Today, every aspect of the Palestinian economy is affected by Israeli policies. For&#160;<br/>example, Palestinian producers must bear costs of exporting and importing that are twice as high as those&#160;<br/>of their Israeli counterparts, while procedures for importing require four times the amount of time Israeli&#160;<br/>importers spend on similar activities, due to the different trading costs and duration requirements imposed&#160;<br/>by Israeli authorities.971<br/>
The olive harvest is an important aspect of Palestinian agriculture and economy and is considered a&#160;<br/>cultural and social event. Between 80,000 and 100,000 families rely on the harvest for their income,&#160;<br/>including unskilled labourers and more than 15% of working women.972&#160;UNCTAD has highlighted that&#160;<br/>Palestinian agricultural livelihood is undermined by the uprooting of and damage to olive trees to facilitate&#160;<br/>settlement expansion. In 2018 alone, Israel uprooted 7,122 olive trees, bringing the total to over 1 million&#160;<br/>trees destroyed since 2000.973&#160;In 2019, the rate of such incidents rose by 16% compared to the previous&#160;<br/>year and by more than 100% compared to 2017.974&#160;During the 2019 olive season (September-November),&#160;<br/>60 incidents were recorded in connection with the uprooting of over 2,700 trees and the destruction of&#160;<br/>approximately 160 tonnes of produce.975<br/>
The fence/wall has worsened the situation by isolating more than 10% of the area of the West Bank, directly&#160;<br/>affecting 219 Palestinian localities, where 2,700 homes and structures were isolated and a further 5,300&#160;<br/>homes and structures were damaged as a result of its construction. Some 80% of Palestinian farmers who&#160;<br/>have land that is between the fence/wall and the Green Line (known as the “seam zone”) have lost access to&#160;<br/>such land.976&#160;For those who still have some access, the restrictions impede essential year-round agricultural&#160;<br/>activities impacting both olive productivity and value. A sample of 16 trees on each side of the separation&#160;<br/>barrier indicated that trees in the “seam zone” were half as productive as trees on the other side of the&#160;<br/>fence/wall.977&#160;In total, the fence/wall undermined the livelihood of 35,000 households.978<br/>
Palestinians wishing to access their farmland in the “seam zone” are required to obtain military permits,&#160;<br/>which they must renew repeatedly.979&#160;Those who manage to obtain permits face further obstacles to access&#160;<br/>and effectively farm their land. Access is only permitted on foot and&#160;through the specific agricultural gates&#160;<br/>that appear on the permits. Israeli soldiers guard the gates, which open two or three times a day. If farmers&#160;<br/>require a tractor or specific agricultural tools, they must apply for special&#160;and additional permits.<br/>
In 2019, Israel’s military designated 74 gates and five checkpoints to&#160;allow access to agricultural land, of&#160;<br/>which only 11 gates opened daily, 10 opened intermittently and most of the remaining 53 only opened&#160;<br/>during the olive season, according to OCHA.980&#160;Meanwhile, that year the Israeli military rejected 4,659 of&#160;<br/>

<a name=182></a>7,483 requests for “seam zone” permits by Palestinians, a 62% refusal rate. Of these refusals, only 1-2%&#160;<br/>were based on security issues. The rest were rejected on bureaucratic grounds or because the Israeli military&#160;<br/>claimed that the land for which the permit was submitted was not in the “seam zone”, in some instances&#160;<br/>claiming that the land was specified as being in the West Bank.981<br/>
<b>LOSS OF TRADITIONAL LIVELIHOODS IN GAZA: DESTRUCTION OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERY SECTORS&#160;<br/></b>Israel also places undue restrictions on movement of people and goods, affecting agriculture and the fishing&#160;<br/>sector in the Gaza Strip and exacerbating high poverty rates and the food insecurity faced by more than two&#160;<br/>thirds of Gaza’s population.982&#160;In addition, Israel has carried out acts of wanton destruction that have directly&#160;<br/>harmed these sectors on which Gazans have historically depended for their livelihoods.<br/>
As mentioned above, over 35% of agricultural land in Gaza is off-limits to Palestinians, enforced by the&#160;<br/>“buffer zone”, which makes the activity a high-risk venture (see section 5.5.2 “Discriminatory allocation of&#160;<br/>resources”).983&#160;An estimated 178,000 people, including 113,000 farmers,984&#160;can no longer access this area.985&#160;&#160;<br/>
According to Al Mezan Center for Human Rights (Al Mezan), from 1 January to 19 November 2020, there&#160;<br/>were 553 incidents of violations against farmers and agricultural lands in the “buffer zone”, which resulted in&#160;<br/>many Palestinians being injured. On 13 October 2020, for instance, Israeli forces entered 300m into the Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip with bulldozers and tanks and severely damaged large areas of agricultural land in addition to irrigation&#160;<br/>systems and piping.986&#160;According to OCHA, between 1 January and 19 October 2020, many of the 42 Israeli&#160;<br/>military incursions into the Gaza Strip included bulldozing agricultural land and destroying crops.987&#160;Gaza’s&#160;<br/>Ministry of Agriculture estimated a USD 27 million loss in the agriculture sector’s greenhouses, agricultural&#160;<br/>lands and poultry farms as a result of the destruction caused by Israel’s military offensive in May 2021.988<br/>
The Israeli army informed Palestinians that they could farm up to 100m from the fence in 2014, yet it has&#160;<br/>attacked Palestinian farmers in this area, sometimes killing or injuring those present in circumstances&#160;<br/>suggesting deliberate attacks.989&#160;According to Gisha, between 2010 and 2017 there were 1,300 incidents&#160;<br/>involving live fire by Israeli forces against farmers, herders, scrap collectors, demonstrators and other Gaza&#160;<br/>residents near the fence separating Gaza from Israel; at least 161 Palestinians were killed and more than&#160;<br/>3,000 injured.990<br/>
Nisreen Qudeh’s case illustrates the cumulative difficulties faced by&#160;farmers in the Gaza Strip resulting from&#160;<br/>years of restrictions under the illegal blockade, Israeli military attacks on farmland and property in the “buffer&#160;<br/>zone” and limited water and electricity supply.<br/>

<a name=183></a><b>NISREEN QUDEH &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
Nisreen Qudeh is a farmer who lives in Khuza’a, a village in the south of the Gaza Strip adjacent to&#160;<br/>the fence separating the territory from Israel. She has four brothers; one was killed by Israeli forces&#160;<br/>in 2002. Her father, Abdul Kareem, died in Jordan during cardiac surgery in 2005. She lives with&#160;<br/>her mother, who has a disability and needs to have regular medical check-ups. In 2014, the Israeli&#160;<br/>military offensive on Gaza destroyed her home. She told Amnesty International what happened:<br/>
<i>It was a nightmare. The [Israeli] army deployed heavy fire power&#160;and was attacking people,&#160;<br/>residential buildings, roads and public infrastructure. I was watching friends and neighbours&#160;<br/>dying in front of me. Some of them were torn to pieces. My mother and I had to leave our&#160;<br/>home in Khuza’a because of the intense shelling. We went to stay at my brother’s home in [the&#160;<br/>nearby city of] Khan Younis on 24 July. We were told then by our neighbours that our house was&#160;<br/>completely destroyed. We stayed at my brother’s home in Khan Younis until the war ended, and&#160;<br/>then we went back to our home. We were shocked to see how the house was turned to rubble.</i><br/>
<i>They destroyed my life and all of my family’s savings and hard work when they destroyed our&#160;<br/>house. Till now I do not know how they destroyed it so easily. My family invested over NIS&#160;<br/>200,000 [USD 64,516] to build the 150m2 house.991&#160;&#160;</i><br/>
Nisreen Qudeh’s plant nursery was damaged during the strike, causing damage worth around USD&#160;<br/>10,000. Israeli authorities did not compensate her or her family. She has been farming for the last&#160;<br/>20 years, but the Israeli blockade on Gaza has increasingly limited her ability to tend to her land&#160;<br/>and export her products. Her family owns 2 dunams of land in Khuza’a, 500m from the fence that&#160;<br/>separates Gaza and Israel. There, she primarily grows tomatoes as they need less water than other&#160;<br/>crops, she said.<br/>
<i>Each plant needs a little over one litre of water per day. Although that does not seem to be&#160;<br/>much, but with the limited water resources in Gaza, it is too much for us. We have been&#160;<br/>completely reliant on water pumped from other areas in the Gaza Strip since the high salinity&#160;<br/>of underground water in our area renders it unsuitable for irrigation. We must pay over NIS 100&#160;<br/>[USD 32] per hour to pump water to the area. This is too expensive for us. We sometimes spend&#160;<br/>as much as 70% of our farming revenue on water and fertilizers alone, leaving us with very little&#160;<br/>reward for our hard work throughout the year…&#160;</i><br/>
<i>The energy crisis is also a big issue for us, and its impact is extremely negative. We sometimes&#160;<br/>need electricity for irrigation systems, but it is only available four to six hours per day and often&#160;<br/>during the night, forcing us sometimes to work at night in the dark.</i><br/>
<i>I personally do not export any of what we produce outside of the Gaza Strip because it is&#160;<br/>extremely difficult to do so due to the blockade. We sell what we produce only to local markets&#160;<br/>in the Gaza Strip. I know that this option does not make us generate much revenue, but it is a&#160;<br/>safer option for us.</i><br/>
<i>This situation is unbearable. I do not think that farmers in other parts of the world need to&#160;<br/>face the same challenges. The blockade on Gaza and the previous&#160;wars have had a significant&#160;<br/>impact on agriculture, severely limiting our access to clean water, land, resources and other&#160;<br/>markets in the world. These challenges have made the already high levels of food insecurity in&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip even worse.</i><br/>

Since 2014, the Israeli military has aerial-sprayed herbicides over Palestinian crops along the fence between&#160;<br/>Gaza and Israel. Israel claims that the spraying is designed to “enable optimal and continuous security&#160;<br/>operations”,992&#160;yet has not provided any evidence to support this claim. In 2016, Israel admitted to spraying&#160;<br/>an estimated 12km2&#160;from the north to the south of Gaza.993&#160;Israel also takes advantage of westward-blowing&#160;<br/>winds that carry the herbicides beyond the purportedly targeted area near the fence into the Gaza Strip.994&#160;<br/>However, the herbicides have destroyed crops and farmlands hundreds of metres deep into Gaza, resulting&#160;<br/>in the loss of livelihoods for Gazan farmers.995&#160;The ICRC has warned that the damage goes beyond the&#160;<br/>immediate economic cost as it has far-reaching health implications.996&#160;One of the herbicides used is the&#160;<br/>probable carcinogen glyphosate, which poses health risks to Palestinians living adjacent to the fence.997&#160;In&#160;<br/>April 2020, Israel’s herbicide spraying damaged 588 dunams of farmland in Gaza, harming the livelihoods of&#160;<br/>93 farmers and exacerbating the lack of sufficient food, according to&#160;Gisha.998<br/>
In its 2019 review, the CESCR expressed concern about the long-lasting and hazardous impact of the aerial&#160;<br/>herbicide spraying by private companies hired by Israel’s Ministry of Defense in areas adjacent to the fence&#160;<br/>between Israel and Gaza, particularly with respect to the impact on crop yield and on the soil in nearby areas.999<br/>

<a name=185></a>In parallel, restrictions by Israel on access to the sea and on the importation of essential equipment, together&#160;<br/>with the ban on fish exports, have severely impacted the fishing industry. Israel also restricts how far off the&#160;<br/>coast fishermen can go, rendering inaccessible to Palestinians 85%&#160;of the fishing area agreed with Israel&#160;<br/>under the Oslo Accords, and prompting the CESCR to express concern in 2019.1000<br/>
In 1995, Israel agreed to designate a maritime zone stretching 20 nautical miles from the Gaza coastline&#160;<br/>for “fishing, recreation and economic activities” for Palestinians.1001&#160;In fact, this agreement has no basis in&#160;<br/>international law (the State of Palestine, under Article 57 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, can&#160;<br/>declare an Exclusive Economic Zone of 200 nautical miles and claim permanent sovereignty over natural&#160;<br/>resources contained within a 60 nautical mile continental slope).1002&#160;Yet Israel has even broken its 20&#160;<br/>nautical mile agreement. It has only allowed Palestinians to fish within&#160;6 nautical miles of Gaza’s coastal line,&#160;<br/>primarily to facilitate Israel’s exploitation of Palestinian natural gas and oil discovered 13 nautical miles off&#160;<br/>the Gaza Strip’s coastal line (see below).1003<br/>
Ever since the discovery of natural oil and gas in 1999, Israel has repeatedly changed the demarcation of&#160;<br/>Gaza’s maritime space, sometimes reducing it to a mere 3 nautical miles,1004&#160;causing deliberate harm to a&#160;<br/>sector that is struggling to survive. An Israeli senior naval official outlined&#160;the rationale behind this policy:&#160;<br/>“These fields have strategic significance and could be easily a target for our neighbours… Usually to protect&#160;<br/>an area, we just make a sterile zone around it. But we can’t do that in international territory.”1005<br/>
In 2019 alone, Israel changed the Gaza fishing zone nine times and&#160;Palestinian fishermen were informed&#160;<br/>19 times of changes to Israel’s demarcation of the allowed fishing zone,1006&#160;including full bans on three&#160;<br/>occasions. To enforce the restrictions, Israel uses lethal force against Palestinian fishermen working&#160;<br/>off Gaza’s coast,1007&#160;and routinely submerges and seizes fishing boats,1008&#160;and damages other fishing&#160;<br/>equipment.1009&#160;Al Mezan’s monitoring and documentation shows that, between the start of 2012 and&#160;<br/>November 2019, the Israeli navy has attacked Palestinian fishermen&#160;with live fire 1,483 times. Six fishermen&#160;<br/>have been killed and 132 injured, including six children. In the same period, the Israeli navy has arrested&#160;<br/>547 fishermen, 40 of them children, confiscated 177 boats and damaged&#160;and destroyed 101 boats.1010&#160;&#160;<br/>
Over the years, the uncertainty and restrictive measures have discouraged Gazans from upgrading and&#160;<br/>maintaining boats and fishing equipment, so the industry has not been&#160;able to take advantage of expanded&#160;<br/>fishing limits when they are introduced.1011&#160;The CESCR has expressed concern about the confiscation of and&#160;<br/>damage to fishing boats, which has deprived Palestinians of their means&#160;of subsistence.1012<br/>

<a name=186></a>The actions of the Israeli authorities have devastated the economic and social conditions of approximately&#160;<br/>4,080 fishermen registered with the Fishermen’s Syndicate and approximately 1,000 workers in fishing-<br/>related occupations.1013&#160;This has led to the collapse of the sector and resulted in approximately 95% of the&#160;<br/>fishermen living below the poverty line in 2018,1014&#160;According to an earlier source in 2011, nearly 90% of&#160;<br/>fishermen were “poor” or “very poor” then, a percentage that had sharply increased from 50% in 2008.1015&#160;&#160;<br/>The lack of access to sufficient fishing waters is also estimated to affect a total of 65,000 people in Gaza.1016&#160;<br/>The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of workers in the fishing sector in 1997 at&#160;<br/>around 10,000.1017<br/>
<b>ZAKARIA BAKER &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
Zakaria Baker is a fisherman and the coordinator of Gaza’s local Fishermen Committees, part of the&#160;<br/>Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC), one of the largest civil society organizations supporting&#160;<br/>fishermen and farmers in the OPT. It was criminalized by Israeli authorities in October 2021 and is now&#160;<br/>at risk of being shut, its assets confiscated and its workers arrested and&#160;prosecuted. Zakaria Baker told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International that Israel harasses and provokes Palestinian&#160;fishermen in Gaza, who are often&#160;<br/>subjected to arbitrary arrests, spraying of their boats with skunk water and confiscation of or shooting at&#160;<br/>their boats by Israel’s navy at sea. According to UAWC documentation, 18 fishermen were wounded by&#160;<br/>Israeli attacks on fishermen at sea from January to August 2020 and&#160;at least nine others were arrested,&#160;<br/>including a minor. He added that seven boats were severely damaged, a large amount of fishing&#160;<br/>equipment was destroyed, and five boats were seized. He told Amnesty International: “The Israeli navy&#160;<br/>invades our fishing zone anytime at free will, they can confiscate boats which cost from USD 10,000 to&#160;<br/>20,000. Imagine the damage this will cause to the fisherman whose&#160;boat has been confiscated.”1018<br/>
Israel severely limits the area in which fishermen can work, frequently changing the permissible fishing&#160;<br/>zone. In 2019 Israel expanded the fishing range allowed for Gaza fisherman to 15 nautical miles,1019&#160;&#160;<br/>but Zakaria Baker explained that this expansion was confined to the&#160;southern part of the zone that&#160;<br/>neighbours Egypt, whereas the northern fishing zone near the border with Israel is still strictly limited to&#160;<br/>6 nautical miles. Israel only allows small boats to sail into the expanded&#160;part of the fishing zone. He told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International: “They [Israeli authorities] keep changing the map whenever they want. It’s so&#160;<br/>vague that it needs a surveying engineer to decode it, instead of simple&#160;fishermen, who lack basic GPS&#160;<br/>navigation tools due to Israel’s blockade.”<br/>
He added that in recent years there has been an increase in incidents where the Israeli navy demands&#160;<br/>that fishermen remove their clothes, jump in the water and swim over to navy vessels:&#160;<br/>
<i>The navy demands that fishermen swim over to them naked regardless of how cold the water is. In&#160;<br/>the winter, they need to swim in really cold water. This is not just a violation of their dignity, it also&#160;<br/>puts their lives at risk for no reason.&#160;</i><br/>

According to Zakaria Baker, Israel’s navy also uses powerful water cannons to flood their&#160;fishing boats,&#160;<br/>intentionally damaging electrical equipment because it is expensive to fix and without them the boats will&#160;<br/>not work. He added that this makes many fishermen in Gaza afraid&#160;to set out to sea.<br/>
<i>The livelihoods of over 3,000 fishermen and other workers in professions associated with the&#160;<br/>fishing sector have been hugely affected [by Israel’s restrictions and&#160;attacks]. These people are&#160;<br/>the main providers for their families. They have no other source of income. Imagine how their lives&#160;<br/>will look like now.</i><br/>
<i>Fishermen in Gaza pay a heavy price for working in this sector. We suffer from the blockade&#160;<br/>and severe restrictions on movement by Israel’s navy and now with measures taken to stop the&#160;<br/>spread of Covid-19, there is even a greater economic uncertainty and increased concern for the&#160;<br/>food security of Gaza’s civilian population. For example, it is now sardine season, one of the most&#160;<br/>profitable fishing seasons of the year. But with the Israeli restrictions on access to the fishing zone&#160;<br/>it enforces in Gaza’s maritime area, the frequent changes it makes to its demarcation, and the&#160;<br/>violent enforcement methods it employs thwart us from making any profit during this season. All&#160;<br/>these measures are severely affecting the livelihoods of thousands of&#160;fishermen, undermining what&#160;<br/>was once an important sector in the Gaza Strip’s economy.</i><br/>

<a name=188></a><b>CONTROL OF WATER IN OPT&#160;<br/></b>Since 1967, Israel has sought to control all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the OPT,&#160;<br/>which has had a major impact on Palestinian communities and their agricultural activities. The amount of&#160;<br/>water that Israel makes available to Palestinians is restricted to a level which does not meet their needs and&#160;<br/>does not constitute a fair and equitable share of the shared water resources. Today, only 10% of Gaza’s&#160;<br/>population has direct access to safe and clean drinking water, while some 660,000 Palestinians in the West&#160;<br/>Bank are estimated to have limited access to water.1020&#160;<br/>
Two months after the start the occupation, Israel placed all water resources in the West Bank and Gaza Strip&#160;<br/>under its military control.1021&#160;In November 1967, the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158 – Order&#160;<br/>Amending the Water Supervision Law, which stated that Palestinians throughout the West Bank could not&#160;<br/>construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit&#160;from the Israeli army. Since then, the&#160;<br/>extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure requires permits&#160;<br/>from Israel, which are nearly impossible to obtain. Palestinians living under Israel’s military occupation&#160;<br/>continue to suffer the devastating consequences of the military order. They are unable to drill new wells,&#160;<br/>install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and freshwater&#160;<br/>springs. Israel even controls the collection of rainwater in most of the West Bank, and the Israeli army often&#160;<br/>destroys rainwater-harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities.1022&#160;As a result, according to a&#160;<br/>report by UNCTAD in 2017, nearly 93% of cultivated Palestinian land was not irrigated.1023&#160;<br/>
While restricting Palestinian access to water, Israel has effectively developed its own water infrastructure&#160;<br/>and network in the West Bank for the use of its own citizens in Israel and in the settlements. Israel has&#160;<br/>transferred 82% of Palestinian groundwater into Israel and for the use of Jewish settlements, while&#160;<br/>Palestinians must purchase over 50% of their water from Israel.1024&#160;The Israeli state-owned water company&#160;<br/>Mekorot has systematically sunk wells and tapped springs in the occupied West Bank to supply its&#160;<br/>population, including those living in illegal settlements, with water for domestic, agricultural and industrial&#160;<br/>purposes.1025&#160;Mekorot does sell some water to Palestinian water utilities, but the amount is determined by the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities, which often cut or decrease the amount provided, leaving many Palestinian communities&#160;<br/>without water or underserved by an essential water supply.&#160;<br/>
Due to continuous restrictions on tapping water resources, many Palestinian communities in the West Bank,&#160;<br/>especially in Area C, have no choice but to buy water brought in by trucks at much higher prices, ranging&#160;<br/>from USD 4 to USD 10 per cubic metre. As a result, Palestinians pay on average at least eight times more&#160;<br/>for water than Israeli settlers.1026&#160;Consequently, in some of the poorest communities, such as in the Jordan&#160;<br/>Valley, water expenses can, at times, use up half of a family’s monthly income.1027&#160;Israeli settlers living in&#160;<br/>the West Bank face no such restrictions and water shortages, and enjoy and capitalize on well-irrigated&#160;<br/>farmlands and swimming pools.1028<br/>

<a name=189></a>The inequality in access to water between Israelis and Palestinians is striking. Average Palestinian&#160;<br/>consumption in the OPT is about 70 litres a day per person, with approximately 420,000 people in the West&#160;<br/>Bank consuming 50 litres a day,1029&#160;less than a quarter of the average Israeli consumption of about 300&#160;<br/>litres. For Israeli settlers residing in Israeli settlements, the average daily water consumption is 369 litres,&#160;<br/>about six times the amount consumed by Palestinians.10231<br/>
The devastating impact of Israel’s discriminatory allocation of the OPT’s natural resources for the benefit&#160;<br/>of Jewish Israelis is perhaps best exemplified in the Jordan Valley. As an area with extremely fertile lands,&#160;<br/>abundant water resources – including a third of the underground water reserves in the West Bank – and&#160;<br/>Dead Sea mineral deposits, it has great potential for agricultural and industrial development and tourism&#160;<br/>for Palestinians.1032&#160;Instead, it is home to some of the West Bank’s poorest Palestinian communities, who&#160;<br/>live in an increasingly coercive environment deliberately designed by the Israeli authorities to force them to&#160;<br/>relocate; they have no access to electricity, running water or their traditional livelihoods, and face an ever-<br/>present risk of having their homes and other property demolished by the Israeli army.<br/>
<b>JORDAN VALLEY &#160; &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
Although the Jordan Valley contains vital land reserves for the natural expansion of Palestinian towns&#160;<br/>and cities, Israel has taken over most of the land with a view to enabling its de facto annexation.&#160;<br/>
As stated already, Israel endeavours to minimize Palestinian presence in the Jordan Valley by barring&#160;<br/>Palestinians from using 85% of the land, restricting their access to water resources and refusing&#160;<br/>their application for building homes. Over the years, Israeli authorities have used different legal and&#160;<br/>coercive measures to enforce this, including the systematic appropriation of Palestinian land for&#160;<br/>the establishment and expansion of Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley, as well as the unlawful&#160;<br/>exploitation of Palestinian natural resources there. Agriculture is the largest economic sector in the&#160;<br/>Jordan Valley for Israeli settlers, who cultivate 33,000 dunams (3,300 hectares) of land, earning them&#160;<br/>USD 130 million annually.1030&#160;Vast mineral deposits in the Dead Sea are also exclusively extracted by&#160;<br/>Israel, which exercises total control over the northern basin of the Dead Sea that lies in the OPT. The&#160;<br/>Israeli economy benefits from this by around USD 3 billion annually.1033&#160;&#160;<br/>
Palestinian dispossession continues until today. In March 2016, Israel appropriated a large tract of land&#160;<br/>in the Jordan Valley for settlement expansion, declaring it to be state land.1034&#160;The appropriation of the&#160;<br/>2,342 dunams was the largest land seizure by Israel in the West Bank since August 2014. In April 2019,&#160;<br/>Israel also seized over 350 dunams of Palestinian agricultural land in the northern part of the Jordan&#160;<br/>Valley.1035<br/>
Historically, the Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley earned their livelihoods through farming&#160;<br/>and herding goats and sheep, and selling the milk and cheese they produced. However, various Israeli&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=190></a>policies have made it impossible for many of them to farm or keep more than a few animals because&#160;<br/>they cannot access sufficient water or land. Of the 42 Israeli drillings&#160;for extracting groundwater in the&#160;<br/>West Bank, 28 are in the Jordan Valley. These 28 provide Israel with some 32 million cubic metres&#160;<br/>of water a year, most of which is allocated to the settlements,1036&#160;thereby allowing them to intensively&#160;<br/>farm throughout the year, with most of the produce being exported. Meanwhile, Palestinian farmers are&#160;<br/>forced to neglect their farmland or switch to less water-intensive crops because of Israel’s discriminatory&#160;<br/>policies on Palestinians’ access to water in the Jordan Valley.1037&#160;<br/>
In parallel, Israel has consolidated complete control of all water resources and water-related infrastructure&#160;<br/>in the Gaza Strip, including the coastal aquifer, which is the only freshwater resource in Gaza. The coastal&#160;<br/>aquifer is located under the coastal plain of Israel and the Gaza Strip. Its yearly sustainable yield is estimated&#160;<br/>at up to 450 million cubic metres in Israel and a mere 55 million cubic metres in Gaza.1038&#160;The aquifer has&#160;<br/>been depleted by over-extraction and contaminated by sewage and seawater infiltration,1039&#160;resulting in more&#160;<br/>than 95% of its water being unfit for human consumption.1040&#160;&#160;<br/>
Despite the dire water shortage in the Gaza Strip, Israel not only does not allow the transfer of water from the&#160;<br/>West Bank to Gaza,1041&#160;but also diverts water from the southern West Bank, preventing Gaza’s coastal aquifer&#160;<br/>from its natural source of replenishment.1042<br/>
<b>CONTROL OF PALESTINIAN OIL AND GAS IN OPT&#160;<br/></b>Israel has also deprived Palestinians in the OPT of access to the oil and gas under their land and coastal&#160;<br/>waters, which has consequently denied them economic development and opportunities to realize other&#160;<br/>socio-economic rights, such as the right to work. The OPT lies above a sizeable reservoir of oil and natural&#160;<br/>gas resources in Area C of the West Bank and the Mediterranean coast off the Gaza Strip, according to&#160;<br/>UNCTAD.1043&#160;The Levant Basin Province in the Eastern Mediterranean is one of the most important sources&#160;<br/>of natural gas in the world.1044&#160;<br/>
Yet Palestinians have been prohibited from exploiting these reserves, estimated at 1.525 billion barrels of&#160;<br/>oil with an estimated value of USD 99.1 billion, to both meet their energy needs and generate fiscal and&#160;<br/>export revenues.1045&#160;UNCTAD estimates that since the beginning of the drilling of two natural gas reserves&#160;<br/>off Gaza’s coast in 2000, the Palestinian economy has been deprived (at a conservative estimate) of USD&#160;<br/>2.57 billion.1046&#160;<br/>

<a name=191></a><b>RESTRICTED ACCESS TO STONE QUARRYING<br/></b>Stone quarrying is Palestinians’ largest export industry, but Israel’s control of the OPT has restricted&#160;<br/>Palestinian access to these resources. In addition, Israel has refused to grant permits for new Palestinian&#160;<br/>quarries or to renew existing licences.1047&#160;Meanwhile, Israel carries out quarrying activities in the OPT,&#160;<br/>in contravention of the law of occupation. In 2009, Israeli rights group Yesh Din petitioned the Supreme&#160;<br/>Court of Israel to demand the halt of all Israel’s quarrying activities in the OPT. The group found that three&#160;<br/>quarters of output from quarrying was transferred to Israel, in clear violation of international law.1048&#160;In&#160;<br/>2012, the Court rejected the petition and effectively “legalized” the activities of Israeli corporations.1049&#160;<br/>Multinational corporations are also involved in quarrying activities in the OPT, contributing to the direct&#160;<br/>funding and maintenance of Israeli settlements, and benefiting from&#160;Israel’s discriminatory policies against&#160;<br/>Palestinians.1050&#160;&#160;<br/>
<b>CONTROL OF DEAD SEA MINERALS<br/></b>While the northern basin of the western bank of the Dead Sea lies in the OPT, Israel exerts total control&#160;<br/>over the area and has been generating revenues from it since 1967. Within 10 years of its occupation,&#160;<br/>Israel had initiated the establishment of 19 settlements in the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea area.1051&#160;<br/>Currently, the regional councils of 37 settlements have de facto jurisdiction over 86% of this area.1052&#160;The six&#160;<br/>Israeli settlements solely in the Dead Sea area exploit Palestinian fertile lands and extract minerals for their&#160;<br/>agriculture and tourism.1053&#160;Jordan controls the eastern side of the Dead Sea. Israel and Jordan have been&#160;<br/>extracting minerals, primarily potash and bromine, and together reap annual revenue of USD 4.2 billion&#160;<br/>from selling these products.1054&#160;Palestinians are not allowed by Israel to exploit the Dead Sea for its mineral&#160;<br/>wealth.1055&#160;If they were, they would generate approximately USD 920 million for their economy, or almost 9%&#160;<br/>of GDP, according to an estimate by the World Bank in 2013.1056<br/>
<b>EXPLOITATION OF PALESTINIAN CULTURAL HERITAGE AND PROPERTY<br/></b>Israel has also used archaeological excavations to retain and control more land for the construction of&#160;<br/>Jewish-only settlements and exploit Palestinians’ natural resources, while barring Palestinians from using or&#160;<br/>accessing the land.1057&#160;Since the outset of its occupation, Israel has effectively retained control of tourism&#160;<br/>and archaeological sites in the West Bank. Israeli authorities found and excavated 980 archaeological sites&#160;<br/>

<a name=192></a>there, including 349 in East Jerusalem, between 1967 and 2007.1058&#160;Jewish settlers, other Israeli citizens&#160;<br/>and Israel’s military have illegally moved archaeological artefacts unearthed in the OPT and displayed them&#160;<br/>as Jewish and Israeli in exhibitions in Israel and abroad, in contravention of international law and treaties on&#160;<br/>cultural property.1059&#160;Israel’s intensive destruction and capture of archaeological sites significantly deprives&#160;<br/>Palestinians of the right to their cultural heritage and property.1060&#160;Further, the development of archaeological&#160;<br/>sites in the occupied West Bank sustains surrounding settlements, mainly through tourism, and exacerbates&#160;<br/>patterns of human rights violations against Palestinians in nearby communities. Indeed, in recent years, the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities have increased their financial support to the tourism industry linked to settlements.1061&#160;&#160;<br/>
<b>ABUSE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES: SHILO SETTLEMENT &#160; &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
Israeli settlers have established several Jewish settlements under the guise of archaeological&#160;<br/>excavations. For instance, in 1979, Jewish settlers moved into what became the settlement of&#160;<br/>Shilo, in the north of the West Bank near Nablus, on the pretext that they were there to work as&#160;<br/>archaeologists.1062&#160;The settlement later received official government approval and&#160;its municipal boundary&#160;<br/>was expanded in 1992 to include the Palestinian-owned farmland containing the ancient ruins and an&#160;<br/>archaeological site.1063&#160;Since the late 1990s, settlers have established more than 10 new settlements&#160;<br/>on the surrounding hills, and continue to expand them through the&#160;confiscation of Palestinian-owned&#160;<br/>land.1064&#160;Shilo settlement alone now houses 3,000 Jewish Israeli settlers. The Israeli government and&#160;<br/>settler organizations have identified the archaeological site in Shilo as one of the most important visitor&#160;<br/>attractions in the West Bank.1065&#160;<br/>
Palestinians from the neighbouring farming villages of Qaryut and Jalud must acquire special permits&#160;<br/>from the Israeli military to access their privately owned land close to the settlements. In total, Jalud has&#160;<br/>lost approximately 35,000 dunams (3,500 hectares) and Qaryut more than 20,000 dunams (2,000&#160;<br/>hectares) of land.1066&#160;This includes farmland and groves that are now included within the boundaries of&#160;<br/>the archaeological site.1067&#160;The consequences for Palestinians of these restrictions and the loss of land&#160;<br/>have been harsh.<br/>

the Mughrabi (Moroccan) Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem, transferred archaeological finds from the Palestine Archaeological Museum&#160;<br/>

Palestinian residents have to endure various Israeli policies, such as barring them from using the main&#160;<br/>road leading from Qaryut to the south of the West Bank as it passes close to the archaeological site, in&#160;<br/>addition to state-sponsored settler violence.1068&#160;Bashar Muammar, a resident of Qaryut, told Amnesty&#160;<br/>International in 2018,&#160;<br/>
<i>People are leaving the village now because we are isolated. Many people sold their lands and&#160;<br/>houses and moved out to Ramallah. The village is not located next to the main road any more so&#160;<br/>no one would come here, unless they have a reason to. Many shops have recently closed because&#160;<br/>their business was not working properly.1069</i><br/>
In stark contrast to the restrictions placed by Israel on the residents of Qaryut and Jalud, the Israeli&#160;<br/>government has supported ambitious plans by the settlers to develop the archaeological site into a&#160;<br/>major tourist attraction. In 2010, the Israeli authorities handed over management of the site to a private&#160;<br/>organization run by settlers,1070&#160;which in 2013 opened a new museum and auditorium.1071&#160;In 2014, the&#160;<br/>settlers also published plans for the expansion of the tourist facilities, including a vast new visitor and&#160;<br/>conference centre with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people a day.1072&#160;Residents of surrounding&#160;<br/>Israeli settlements have sought to profit from the growth in tourism by&#160;advertising their homes on digital&#160;<br/>tourism websites, such as Airbnb and Booking.com.1073<br/>

1071.&#160;The new museum, as well as the film shown in the auditorium, highlight the belief that&#160;several important Biblical episodes took&#160;<br/>
place at the location. By contrast, Amnesty International researchers noted, when visiting on 7 June 2018, that the museum and the film&#160;<br/>
downplay or ignore the most significant ruins at the site: two mosques and a Byzantine church. The presence – for centuries – of Arabs&#160;<br/>
on the land is ignored. Indeed, the site’s managers present Tel Shiloh as an integral part of Israel and there is an Israeli flag flying at its&#160;<br/>
entrance.&#160;<br/>
1072.&#160;The plan has been contested by the Israeli organization Emek Shaveh, which filed a petition with the High Court; a decision was&#160;<br/>
pending as of the end of August 2021. See, for example, Emek Shaveh,&#160;<i>Tel Shiloh (Khirbet Seilun): Archaeological Settlement in the&#160;</i><br/>

<a name=194></a><b>5.5.3 DISCRIMINATORY PROVISION OF SERVICES&#160;<br/></b>Across Israel and the OPT, millions of Palestinians live in densely populated areas that are generally&#160;<br/>underdeveloped and lack adequate essential services such as garbage collection, electricity, public transportation&#160;<br/>and water and sanitation infrastructure, and often face arbitrary restrictions in their access to healthcare.&#160;<br/>
In areas under full Israeli control such as the Negev/Naqab, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank,&#160;<br/>the denial of essential services is inherently linked to discriminatory planning and zoning policies, which&#160;<br/>force Palestinians to build without permits, and is intended to create unbearable living conditions to force&#160;<br/>Palestinians to leave their homes to allow for the expansion of Jewish settlement. In addition, Israeli policies&#160;<br/>of exclusion, segregation and severe restrictions on movement in the entirety of the West Bank and the&#160;<br/>Gaza Strip mean that Palestinians face difficulties accessing healthcare, including life-saving treatment, and&#160;<br/>education even though Israel bears the responsibility under international law to provide such services not&#160;<br/>just to its own population but also to Palestinians living under its military occupation. When they manage to&#160;<br/>access such services, they are in general inferior to those provided to Jewish Israeli citizens. These policies&#160;<br/>severely impact Palestinians’ socio-economic rights and prevent them&#160;from fulfilling their human potential.&#160;<br/>
<b>DECADES OF NEGLECT: LACK OF ACCESS TO ADEQUATE ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN EAST JERUSALEM &#160; &#160;</b><br/>
As mentioned above, even though Palestinian residents of Jerusalem comprise 38% of the population&#160;<br/>of the city, they receive less than 10% of Jerusalem Municipality’s budget; Jewish Israeli residents (most&#160;<br/>of whom live in West Jerusalem) receive more than 90%.1074&#160;Palestinians live in densely populated areas&#160;<br/>of the city that lack adequate essential services, which are inferior to services provided to residents and&#160;<br/>citizens in other parts of Israel, including education and healthcare. Despite some recent improvements,&#160;<br/>their neighbourhoods are poorly connected to other parts of the city with public transportation and the&#160;<br/>road network has been intentionally designed to prevent future urban expansion. Roads are narrow and&#160;<br/>full of holes, and are unsuitable for the large volume of traffic in the densely populated area. They are&#160;<br/>also unsafe, and largely lack barriers and sidewalks.1075<br/>
Residents in East Jerusalem face discrimination in the provision of services in virtually all aspects of&#160;<br/>their daily lives. For example, despite high poverty rates in East Jerusalem, according to ACRI, access&#160;<br/>to welfare services is extremely limited with only six offices providing&#160;assistance to nearly 335,000&#160;<br/>people. By contrast, some 570,000 Jewish Israeli residents of Jerusalem&#160;have access to 19 such offices,&#160;<br/>meaning that on average, welfare offices in East Jerusalem deal with&#160;nearly double the number of clients&#160;<br/>as offices in West Jerusalem.1076<br/>
In 2019, a report by Israel’s State Comptroller criticized both the Jerusalem municipality and the&#160;<br/>Israeli government for their discriminatory treatment of Palestinians in East Jerusalem. It noted that the&#160;<br/>service provided by the Ministry of Interior’s Population and Immigration Authority to residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem was “far inferior to that given to citizens in the rest of the country”. Amongst other concerns,&#160;<br/>the report also noted disproportionately higher poverty rates amongst East Jerusalem and disparities in&#160;<br/>the handling of garbage collection between East and West Jerusalem. For example, despite the fact that&#160;<br/>38% of the city’s total population live in East Jerusalem, the municipality only makes 7% of dumpsters&#160;<br/>and 6% of garbage disposal routes available to East Jerusalemites.1077<br/>

<a name=195></a>In another example of unequal provision of services, there are only eight&#160;post offices in East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>compared to 33 such offices in West Jerusalem, numbers which are not proportionate to the difference&#160;<br/>in the size of the two populations.1078&#160;Similarly, there is a shortage of public parks and playgrounds in&#160;<br/>Palestinian neighbourhoods. While there are “hundreds of playgrounds” in West Jerusalem, according&#160;<br/>to Bimkom, by 2019 the authorities had only built 20 playgrounds in East Jerusalem, which they rarely&#160;<br/>maintain leading to their rapid deterioration.1079<br/>
For the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem residing in isolated communities beyond the fence/wall,&#160;<br/>who constitute more than a third of the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem, the situation is much&#160;<br/>worse.1080&#160;Israeli authorities severely neglect and discriminate against them in budget allocation and&#160;<br/>municipal services, while directing spending to Jewish Israeli neighbourhoods in Jerusalem.1081<br/>
In May 2018, the Israeli government adopted Government Resolution 3790 on “Narrowing Socio-<br/>Economic Gaps and Economic Development in East Jerusalem”, which allocated NIS 2 billion (over USD&#160;<br/>645 million) to improve education, create jobs and upgrade public spaces in East Jerusalem. Although&#160;<br/>the plan has the potential to improve essential services, the allocated budget is unlikely to address socio-<br/>economic gaps between East and West Jerusalem created by years of deliberate neglect. Crucially, it&#160;<br/>failed to change discriminatory planning and building policies and, as such, does not address the root&#160;<br/>causes behind the discriminatory provision of services. The real motivation behind the plan appears&#160;<br/>to be to further consolidate control over East Jerusalem with analysts noting that “The Netanyahu&#160;<br/>government has conceded that its neglect of East Jerusalem has failed to induce Palestinians to&#160;<br/>leave.”1082&#160;(See below for details on funding for education allocated under this Government Resolution.)<br/>
<b>SUBSTANDARD WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES<br/></b>Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip and other discriminatory policies have created a water and sanitation&#160;<br/>crisis characterized by an acute shortage lack of potable water, reduced ability to filter water and water&#160;<br/>pollution. The routine power cuts and lack of equipment and resources to treat sewage, wastewater and solid&#160;<br/>waste puts the population of Gaza at increased risks of waterborne diseases and other health problems in&#160;<br/>the context of a collapsing health sector.1083<br/>
As a result of these various factors, the piped water in Gaza is unfit for&#160;human consumption and Palestinians&#160;<br/>are not able use it for drinking or cooking. Instead, according to OCHA, 90% of households in Gaza, which&#160;<br/>are already impoverished, have to buy water from desalination or purification plants, costing between 10 and&#160;<br/>30 times more than piped water. It is commonly delivered by water tankers.1084<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=196></a>In 2021, water and sanitation infrastructure in Gaza reached a crisis point, exacerbated by the stringent&#160;<br/>restrictions imposed for over 14 years by Israel on the entry into Gaza of material and equipment necessary&#160;<br/>for its development and repair. As a result, Gazans lose on average 40% of their domestic supply because&#160;<br/>of leakages in Gaza’s old water infrastructure, which has sustained considerable damage over the years.1085&#160;<br/>During Israel’s 50-day military operation in the Gaza Strip in 2014,1086&#160;Israeli forces destroyed the main&#160;<br/>water and sanitation infrastructure.1087&#160;Israel also targeted infrastructure during the 10-21 May 2021 military&#160;<br/>operation in the Gaza Strip. According to OCHA, water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure was severely&#160;<br/>affected, with wastewater networks, pipelines, wells, a wastewater pumping station and service vehicles&#160;<br/>damaged in 93 Israeli strikes. Compounded by the lack of power supply, three main desalination plants&#160;<br/>providing drinking water for more than 400,000 people suspended operations as did sewage treatment&#160;<br/>facilities, resulting in more than 100,000 cubic metres of untreated or partially treated wastewater being&#160;<br/>discharged into the sea every day.1088&#160;Further, the limited entry of fuel and the damage to the electricity&#160;<br/>network reduced access to electricity to a daily average of four to six hours throughout Gaza, further limiting&#160;<br/>the provision of water and treatment of sewage.1089&#160;An estimated 800,000 people lacked regular access to&#160;<br/>piped water.1090&#160;<br/>
Palestinians in East Jerusalem also suffer from poor water and sanitation infrastructure,1091&#160;in part because&#160;<br/>they are connected to different water systems with only some areas connected to the Israel national water&#160;<br/>network, and older houses not connected to any water grid or sewage infrastructure.1092&#160;As of 2018, only&#160;<br/>44% of Palestinian households in East Jerusalem were formally connected to the network supplying water&#160;<br/>for drinking and other domestic purposes, with residents of communities beyond the fence/wall most&#160;<br/>affected.1093&#160;Further, an assessment by the Hagihon water company estimated in April 2021 that some 24km&#160;<br/>of new sewage lines were needed in East Jerusalem, partly to eliminate the use of cesspits.1094&#160;According to&#160;<br/>ACRI, this is the result of the authorities’ failure to provide plans for Palestinian neighbourhoods and to set&#160;<br/>up infrastructure that takes into account population growth.&#160;<br/>
In addition, Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of West Bank, including specialized industrial&#160;<br/>zones located in and around settlements, contribute to the pollution of fresh water and groundwater with&#160;<br/>both treated and untreated waste, as well as the pollution of air and soil. In one example, Wadi al-Nar, which&#160;<br/>is considered the most polluted area of the West Bank, receives 13 million cubic metres of sewage each&#160;<br/>year from Jerusalem and Palestinian communities. Whilst Israel recently began the construction of filtration&#160;<br/>and purification facilities to treat sewage in the area, the project is seemingly intended to benefit only Israeli&#160;<br/>settlers by treating their wastewater and providing them with treated water for irrigation.1095<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=197></a>As mentioned above, as a result of discriminatory planning and zoning policies, which force Palestinians&#160;<br/>to build homes and other structures illegally, the Israeli authorities do not provide adequate housing or&#160;<br/>essential services such as water and sanitation, healthcare, education, public transport or electricity to 35&#160;<br/>unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab and the vast majority of Palestinian communities in Area&#160;<br/>C of the West Bank even though they constitute some of Israel’s and the OPT’s most vulnerable populations.&#160;<br/>
According to OCHA, in 2016, some 180 Palestinian rural communities in the West Bank – located primarily&#160;<br/>in Area C – did not have access to running water and an additional 122 communities did not have regular&#160;<br/>supply despite being connected to the water network.1096&#160;They are also prevented from repairing existing&#160;<br/>infrastructure including water cisterns and, as mentioned above, are forced to rely on water trucking at a&#160;<br/>high price and rainwater harvesting (see section 5.5.3 “Discriminatory provision of services”). Given that&#160;<br/>these alternatives rarely meet their domestic and livelihood needs, many families limit their daily water&#160;<br/>consumption exposing them to health risks, which also result from poorer hygiene.1097<br/>
Similarly, the vast majority of these communities are not connected to wastewater services and do not&#160;<br/>have access to functioning external or internal latrines, according to a humanitarian assessment carried&#160;<br/>out in June 2021. Further, existing sanitation facilities “do not satisfy the WHO minimum requirements for&#160;<br/>adequate hygiene, privacy, and dignity”.1098&#160;Meanwhile, Jewish settlements located in Area C enjoy regular&#160;<br/>water supply and are connected to a wastewater infrastructure.&#160;<br/>
The plight of Palestinians in Al-Hadidiya in the Jordan Valley illustrates these disparities.&#160;<br/>
<b>AL-HADIDIYA COMMUNITY IN JORDAN VALLEY &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
The village of Al-Hadidiya is in the north of the Jordan Valley on land the Palestinian residents leased&#160;<br/>from the West Bank governorate of Tubas. The village’s nearly 200 residents earn their living as&#160;<br/>shepherds and farmers.1099&#160;Israel established the settlements of Ro’i in 1976, which has a population of&#160;<br/>175 settlers;1100&#160;and Beka’ot in 1972, which has a population of 182 settlers, allocating them parts of the&#160;<br/>farmland of Al-Hadidiya.1101<br/>
Al-Hadidiya is not connected to a water grid and is deliberately cut off from any regular water supply&#160;<br/>despite its proximity to Beka’ot, which has a water pump installed by the Israeli state-owned water&#160;<br/>company Mekorot. The pump provides water only to the settlements of Ro’i and Beka’ot. As a result, the&#160;<br/>average water consumption of a Palestinian in Al-Hadidiya is 20 litres per person per day, compared to a&#160;<br/>daily water allotment for household use alone per settler of over 460 litres (over 23 times more).1102<br/>
Before Israel’s occupation of the West Bank in 1967, residents of Al-Hadidiya lived a few kilometres&#160;<br/>east of the village’s current location. The site was declared to be a “firing zone” and the residents were&#160;<br/>

The residents filed a petition to&#160;the Supreme Court of Israel against the&#160;<br/>expulsion, which was rejected in 2003, and the residents were forced to leave. However, the Israeli&#160;<br/>Civil Administration issued demolition orders for structures built in the new location as well, claiming&#160;<br/>it was designated agricultural land.1103&#160;The villagers filed another petition in March 2004, but it was&#160;<br/>rejected in December 2006 after the Supreme Court declined to intervene in the actions of the Civil&#160;<br/>Administration. Palestinian residents of the community have been forcibly displaced at least five times&#160;<br/>since 2006.1104<br/>
Due to these and other policies, the Israeli authorities have forced the residents of Al-Hadidiya to live&#160;<br/>in extremely difficult conditions. The Palestinians are forbidden from building permanent structures&#160;<br/>by discriminatory planning and building laws and are consequently forced to live in tents and shacks&#160;<br/>that provide little protection from the harsh weather. Israeli authorities consider these structures to&#160;<br/>be “illegal” and have demolished them on several occasions. According to OCHA, between January&#160;<br/>2009 and 19 August 2020, Israel demolished 119 structures in Al-Hadidiya, displacing 142 people&#160;<br/>and affecting a total of 430 people.1105&#160;Of these demolished structures, 37 were homes and 63 were&#160;<br/>agricultural structures.&#160;<br/>
Children of the community need to travel more than 10km to go to the nearest school in the village of&#160;<br/>Tammun, also in the Tubas governorate. While residents of Al-Hadidiya must travel several kilometres&#160;<br/>to buy water for cooking and other basic needs, Israeli settlers living in the surrounding settlements&#160;<br/>have well-watered gardens and pools, and use water for intensive farming.<br/>
Abu Saqer, a community leader in Al-Hadidiya, told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>In one incident, which took place on 11 October 2020, one of our young men was attacked by&#160;<br/>Israeli settlers, while he was herding his sheep. According to their allegations, he was invading&#160;<br/>the settlement’s “space” so they chased him out of the area, scared his sheep, followed him&#160;<br/>home, and ransacked his home.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>In another incident, the settlement’s security guards attacked my youngest daughter Sumoud,&#160;<br/>14 years old, as she was attending to our sheep on nearby land that I have sowed and cared for.&#160;<br/>It was 10 in the morning, and a security officer raced through with his jeep trying to scare my&#160;<br/>daughter and our herd, and I’m not sure if this was because it was too hot or if he was moving&#160;<br/>too fast but his jeep rolled over, killing four of our sheep. Imagine that my daughter Sumoud,&#160;<br/>only 14 years old, had to deal with this on her own. Think of the ramifications this will have on&#160;<br/>Sumoud and children like her in the future.1106</i><br/>

None of the unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab region of Israel is properly connected to the&#160;<br/>national&#160;water&#160;network,&#160;meaning&#160;that&#160;villagers&#160;access&#160;water through&#160;expensive&#160;third-party&#160;suppliers,&#160;a central&#160;<br/>water point in the village or a central water point in a neighbouring village.1108&#160;They are also forced to rely&#160;<br/>on generators for electricity. Meanwhile, residents in nearby Jewish localities enjoy state-provided services&#160;<br/>including running water, electricity and access to municipal sewerage systems.<br/>
In its 2019 concluding remarks CERD expressed concern at the general substandard living conditions of&#160;<br/>the Bedouin in both the unrecognized villages and the recognized townships in the Negev/Naqab.1109&#160;The&#160;<br/>CESCR has also expressed concern that none of the unrecognized villages in the Negev/Naqab is connected&#160;<br/>to the national water network and that the majority of Bedouin villages, recognized or unrecognized, are not&#160;<br/>connected to a sewage disposal infrastructure.1110<br/>
The case of Al-Araqib is emblematic of the deprivation of social and economic rights faced by residents of&#160;<br/>unrecognized Bedouin villages as a result of Israel’s planning and building regime.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=200></a><b>UNRECOGNIZED VILLAGE OF AL-ARAQIB &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
The village of Al-Araqib is home to the Al-Turi tribe. The village is located north of Beersheba in the&#160;<br/>Negev/Naqab desert and is one of the 35 unrecognized villages, rendering any construction illegal&#160;<br/>in the village. Israeli authorities have demolished Al-Araqib many times. Following the repeated&#160;<br/>demolitions, many residents have left the village and the current residents are forced to live in the&#160;<br/>vicinity of the village cemetery. At least 400 people lived in the village before demolitions began in&#160;<br/>2010, according to the NCF.&#160;<br/>
Al-Araqib was established during the Ottoman period on land that was purchased by the village’s&#160;<br/>residents in 1906.1111&#160;Shortly after the creation of Israel in 1948, residents of Al-Araqib were&#160;<br/>told to temporarily vacate their village after it was declared a military zone. Residents were then&#160;<br/>permanently banned from returning. In the 1970s, former residents submitted multiple claims of&#160;<br/>land ownership to Israeli authorities to allow them to return to Al-Araqib. They were all rejected.1112<br/>
In the early 2000s, residents returned to live on their land in Al-Araqib without permission, even&#160;<br/>though Israeli authorities deemed them as trespassers and did not recognize the village. On 27&#160;<br/>July 2010, Israeli forces demolished the entire village and since then had destroyed it at least 186&#160;<br/>times as of April 2021.1113&#160;Residents continue to rebuild their tents and small homes, or some of&#160;<br/>them, after each demolition. In 2019, residents were required to pay the state NIS 1.3 million (USD&#160;<br/>419,000) for their own eviction costs.1114<br/>
The Israeli authorities’ actions in Al-Araqib systematically violate the villagers’ right to adequate&#160;<br/>housing, a right enshrined in the ICESCR. Amnesty International has repeatedly condemned&#160;<br/>demolitions that aim to forcibly evict residents of Al-Araqib from the land they have lived on for&#160;<br/>generations.<br/>
Israeli authorities have long denied residents of Al-Araqib essential state services. No state health or&#160;<br/>education services are provided because of the village’s unrecognized status. Instead, residents rely&#160;<br/>on informal infrastructure networks. For example, villagers travel to the city of Rahat, 6km away, to&#160;<br/>access schools and receive basic healthcare. Al-Araqib is also disconnected from the Israeli water&#160;<br/>network and electricity grid, forcing residents to rely on private generators, solar panels and water&#160;<br/>brought from trucks at a much higher price. Residents who buy water from Mekorot, the Israeli state-<br/>owned water company, pay up to 67% more for water than those connected to the state-provided&#160;<br/>water network.1115&#160;Residents are also forced to transport water in containers for up to 18km.1116<br/>
By contrast, the Jewish community of Givot Bar, adjacent to Al-Araqib, has an abundance of water&#160;<br/>and state-provided services. In 2004, the community was established by the minister of housing,&#160;<br/>spearheaded by the OR Movement, which constructed 10 mobile homes overnight.1117&#160;The&#160;<br/>

<b>UNEQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES<br/></b>The Israeli government discriminates when providing funds to the health system serving Palestinian citizens&#160;<br/>of Israel, even though they have worse health than their Jewish Israeli counterparts (see section 5.5.2&#160;<br/>“Discriminatory allocation of resources”), which in large part is due to socio-economic factors: education;&#160;<br/>employment; allocation of land for residential use; lack of infrastructure, including connection to the national&#160;<br/>electricity grid; running water; paved roads; sewage disposal systems; regulation and control of air and&#160;<br/>noise pollution; high urban density; and lack of designated funding for urban development that enables and&#160;<br/>encourages healthy lifestyles.1122<br/>

<a name=203></a>As the NGO Physicians for Human Rights – Israel points out, the discrimination and exclusion of Arab&#160;<br/>citizens and residents in Arab localities also negatively impact their ability to engage in health-promoting&#160;<br/>lifestyles and preventive medicine leading to illnesses such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes even&#160;<br/>though health gaps between the Jewish and Arab populations could be greatly reduced by providing&#160;<br/>sufficient resources for determinants of health to all Arab local localities.1123&#160;Additionally, nutritional&#160;<br/>insecurity, another factor closely connected to illnesses associated with nutrition and stress, is far more&#160;<br/>prevalent in the Arab population.1124<br/>
Palestinian citizens of Israel also face physical barriers to accessing healthcare services. For example,&#160;<br/>40.5% of Jewish respondents to a 2018 ICBS survey (see section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human&#160;<br/>development”) stated there was a direct bus route from their home to a local medical facility, compared to&#160;<br/>only 14.6% of Arabs respondents. Similar inequalities were observed for patients making appointments:&#160;<br/>77.9% of Jewish respondents compared to 54.5% of Arab respondents stated they were given an&#160;<br/>appointment within a week of their request.1125<br/>
For Palestinian Bedouins living in the Negev/Naqab, accessibility of health services is even worse, as there&#160;<br/>are no medical clinics in most Bedouin villages.1126&#160;Israel does not provide healthcare facilities or medical&#160;<br/>services in unrecognized villages. These villages are not connected to public transport, forcing families to&#160;<br/>travel long distances to receive basic healthcare.1127&#160;Adalah has argued that Israeli authorities intentionally&#160;<br/>make healthcare inaccessible for Palestinian citizens of Israel in unrecognized villages, in part to create a&#160;<br/>coercive environment to force residents to leave the villages.1128&#160;<br/>
At the same time, the higher poverty rates of the Arab population prevent many from being able to purchase&#160;<br/>supplementary and private health insurance. In recent decades, the Israeli government has adopted a&#160;<br/>policy of privatization and budgetary erosion of social programmes, which have undermined public services,&#160;<br/>including healthcare for all Israeli citizens, but with a more critical impact on marginalized communities&#160;<br/>such as the Arab population.1129&#160;The effects of these policy changes have weakened public health services,&#160;<br/>reduced medical staffing in the geographic periphery, and complicated access to medical offices and clinics&#160;<br/>for newborn babies.1130&#160;This, combined with worse health outcomes, means that Arabs are likely to spend&#160;<br/>much more on medication than their Jewish counterparts, despite having less income.1131<br/>
Palestinians’ unequal access to health services in Israel is reflected&#160;in a range of health outcomes and&#160;<br/>impacts their enjoyment of their right to health. Various official statistics reveal significant health gaps&#160;<br/>between the Jewish and Arab populations, with the latter universally scoring worse. According to a study&#160;<br/>based on Israeli government data in 2019: infant mortality for Arab citizens of Israel (5.4 per 1,000 births)&#160;<br/>was more than double that for Jewish Israelis (2.4); average life expectancy for Arab citizens of Israel was&#160;<br/>79.5 compared to 83.1 for Jewish Israelis; and mortality rates due to illness among Arab citizens of Israel&#160;<br/>were, per 1,000 people, 7.1 for men and 4.9 for women, compared to 5.5 for men and 3.9 for women&#160;<br/>

<a name=204></a>among Jewish Israelis.1132&#160;Self-assessed health is lower for respondents among Arab citizens of Israel (49%&#160;<br/>assessed their health as very good), compared to Jewish Israeli respondents (56% assessed their health as&#160;<br/>very good).1133<br/>
In addition, the ICBS 2018 social survey found that 16.1% of Arab respondents forewent medical treatment&#160;<br/>for financial reasons, more than double the rate of Jewish respondents (7.9%).1134&#160;Moreover, the proportion&#160;<br/>of Arab respondents who stated they had to forego medication for this reason (16.7%) was three times&#160;<br/>higher than among Jewish respondents (4.8%).1135&#160;<br/>
In its 2020 review, CERD expressed concern about the disproportionately poor health status of the&#160;<br/>“Palestinian and Bedouin” populations, including shorter life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality&#160;<br/>compared to the Jewish population.1136&#160;Similar concerns were also expressed by the CESCR in 2019.1137<br/>
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel’s half-a-century-long military occupation does not just impact&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ standard of health but also their ability to access the necessary care and treatment, in particular&#160;<br/>specialized treatment for serious medical conditions. Israel does not extend coverage of its health system&#160;<br/>to the OPT (excluding annexed East Jerusalem), despite its obligations under international humanitarian&#160;<br/>law to ensure and maintain public health and hygiene in the occupied territory and under human rights&#160;<br/>law to ensure the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to everyone under its effective&#160;<br/>control.1138&#160;Israel does, however, provide health coverage for Israeli settlers in the same territory.<br/>
The Oslo Accords transferred the responsibility for the provision of healthcare of Palestinians in Gaza and&#160;<br/>the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, to the Palestinian authorities, who face numerous Israeli-imposed&#160;<br/>constraints on their capacity to fulfil such responsibilities.1139&#160;As a result, according to the WHO, the health&#160;<br/>sector in the OPT is fragmented and largely donor-dependent; it also lacks adequate specialized health&#160;<br/>services and remains underfunded, which exacerbates its fragility.1140<br/>
In addition to the Ramallah-based Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and the de facto Hamas&#160;<br/>administration in the Gaza Strip, healthcare in the OPT is provided by UNRWA as well as a range of private&#160;<br/>and non-governmental institutions. In Area C of the West Bank, where the Palestinian authorities have no&#160;<br/>jurisdiction, healthcare for Palestinians is largely provided through mobile clinics that are run by private and&#160;<br/>non-governmental organizations.&#160;<br/>
Although Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are entitled to Israeli health services and health insurance&#160;<br/>provided in Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, in practice, they rely on a network of six Palestinian-run private&#160;<br/>hospitals for their primary healthcare.1141&#160;The hospitals also provide specialized medical treatment for&#160;<br/>
1132.&#160;With respect to mortality as a result of illness, the rate is much higher among Arabs. For example, the cancer mortality rate for Jewish&#160;<br/>
males is about 38% compared to 47% for Arab males. Among women, the rate is 31% and 38.4% respectively. Physicians for Human&#160;<br/>

<a name=205></a>Palestinians from the rest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, referred by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.&#160;<br/>The consequence of this overreliance on donor funding was exemplified by the impact of a 2018 decision&#160;<br/>of the US administration to cut USD 25 million in financial aid to the&#160;East Jerusalem Hospital Network. This&#160;<br/>affected critical medical care, including cardiac surgery, neonatal intensive care, radiation therapy and&#160;<br/>paediatric dialysis, especially for Palestinian patients referred by the Palestinian Ministry of Health from other&#160;<br/>parts of the OPT, where such services are unavailable.1142<br/>
<b>CRUEL AND ARBITRARY RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OPT<br/></b>When specialized and potentially life-saving healthcare is unavailable in medical facilities in the rest of the&#160;<br/>West Bank and the Gaza Strip, patients are referred to East Jerusalem, Israel or abroad. However, this option&#160;<br/>is often hindered by the discriminatory Israeli policies and practices described throughout this report.1143&#160;&#160;<br/>
Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank referred to receive medical care in East Jerusalem or Israel, as&#160;<br/>well as medical staff who hold West Bank IDs, must apply for an Israeli military permit on humanitarian&#160;<br/>grounds to access medical facilities there. On average, each year around 200,000 Palestinians are required&#160;<br/>to apply for these permits either to receive medical care in East Jerusalem or Israel, or for family members&#160;<br/>to accompany patients, according to the WHO.1144&#160;There are usually more than 2,000 permit applications&#160;<br/>each month for patients from Gaza, of which a third are for cancer treatment. Nearly 80% of all permits are&#160;<br/>approved; the remaining 20% are either denied or not approved in time.1145&#160;<br/>
The permits are difficult to obtain and the process for obtaining them&#160;remains unclear. The vast majority of&#160;<br/>unsuccessful applicants do not receive explanations for the denial or delay of their permits.1146&#160;According to&#160;<br/>the WHO, “While there is no published eligibility criteria for obtaining a permit, data collection and interview&#160;<br/>findings indicate that factors which appear to affect edibility [sic] include&#160;age, sex, residency, civilian status,&#160;<br/>timing of travel, kind of medical treatment, and family relationships, in addition to unexplained ‘security’&#160;<br/>reasons of Israeli authorities.”1147<br/>
The permit regime has a particularly devastating impact on the health of Palestinians in Gaza where the&#160;<br/>blockade and other Israeli policies of segregation, coupled with a chronic energy crisis, have undermined the&#160;<br/>availability and quality of health services and left the system close to collapse. Additionally, the Ramallah-<br/>based Palestinian authorities’ reduction of essential services to the Gaza Strip, including electricity and&#160;<br/>medical supplies, undermines Palestinians’ right to health. Egypt has kept the Rafah crossing mostly closed&#160;<br/>since 2013, which has also restricted access to healthcare.1148<br/>
As a result, Palestinians in Gaza are unable to enjoy and access adequate healthcare including life-saving&#160;<br/>and other emergency medical treatment. Treatment for cancer1149&#160;and other chronic illnesses as well&#160;<br/>as specialized paediatric, cardiology and haematology services are severely limited due to severe and&#160;<br/>continuous shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which Israel prohibits from entering under the&#160;<br/>

<a name=206></a>“dual use” policy (see section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human development”).1150&#160;According&#160;<br/>to the WHO, the policy has also affected the supply of electricity generators for hospitals; communications&#160;<br/>equipment for coordinating ambulances and emergency response; and a large number of people with&#160;<br/>disabilities, as certain materials and equipment, such as nuclear scanning technology,1151&#160;as well as&#160;<br/>carbon fibre and epoxy resins used in some types of prosthetic limbs, are prohibited from being delivered&#160;<br/>to Gaza, leaving patients with heavier and more uncomfortable alternatives.1152&#160;The WHO also reported&#160;<br/>that Palestinians have to pay more for medication than international standard prices because of import&#160;<br/>restrictions and their limited ability to negotiate lower prices.1153<br/>
In addition, Israel has not allowed certain types of medical equipment to leave Gaza for repair. For instance,&#160;<br/>after three years of denying permits, in June and July 2020, following legal intervention by Gisha, the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities finally allowed a device used for treating burns, the only one&#160;of its kind in Gaza, to be shipped&#160;<br/>for repair.1154&#160;In parallel, punitive measures taken by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank to reduce&#160;<br/>essential services to the Gaza Strip since 2017 have exacerbated the impact of Israeli restrictions. They too&#160;<br/>have violated Gazans’ right to health by reducing their access to medical supplies and electricity essential for&#160;<br/>the healthcare system.1155&#160;Meanwhile, Egypt has kept the Rafah Crossing mostly closed for the population in&#160;<br/>Gaza since 2013, which has also restricted access to healthcare.1156<br/>
The Covid-19 pandemic has further debilitated the health system. According to OCHA, as of March 2021,&#160;<br/>50% of essential drugs were at zero-stock level (less than a month’s supply) compared with 45% in February&#160;<br/>due to the impact of Covid-19. This percentage was the highest recorded since September 2019.1157&#160;In&#160;<br/>May 2021, there were more than 9,500 active cases in Gaza1158&#160;and just over 38,000 residents had been&#160;<br/>vaccinated1159&#160;– far short of what is needed for a population of some 2 million. In April 2021, hospitals were&#160;<br/>already struggling to admit new patients with insufficient intensive care capacity and shortage of essential&#160;<br/>medication.1160<br/>
As a result, Palestinians from Gaza are often forced to rely on the more advanced healthcare in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and elsewhere in the West Bank, in Israel and abroad. Yet the Israeli authorities often delay&#160;<br/>permits and sometimes fail to provide them at all.1161&#160;According to the WHO, patients applying to leave Gaza&#160;<br/>for healthcare in 2018 had the second lowest approval rate recorded by the WHO since 2006, with 15,834&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>

<a name=207></a>of 25,811 patient permit applications approved (61.4%).1162&#160;This low level persisted until July 2020.1163&#160;From&#160;<br/>January to May 2020, 67% of patient applications for permits to leave Gaza were successful.1164<br/>
It appears that, in some cases, Israel’s denial of permits to leave Gaza for medical treatment is intended&#160;<br/>as a punitive measure. For example, in the context of the Great March of Return protests, according to&#160;<br/>OCHA, Israeli forces injured over 8,000 Palestinian civilians with live ammunition, 1,200 of whom require&#160;<br/>long-term rehabilitation, including 156 who had to have limbs amputated.1165&#160;According to the WHO, the&#160;<br/>permit approval rate for Palestinians injured in the Great March of Return protests who needed treatment&#160;<br/>outside Gaza was significantly lower than the overall approval rate for patient permit applications to exit&#160;<br/>Gaza. Between 30 March 2018 and 30 September 2019, there were 591 patient permit applications from&#160;<br/>Palestinians injured in the Great March of Return protests; 18% (104) were approved, 27% (161) were&#160;<br/>denied and 55% (326) were delayed.1166&#160;This pattern applied to children as well as to adults. According&#160;<br/>to a 2019 report by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the OPT, the approval rate&#160;<br/>for permit applications for children to cross into Israel for medical treatment was significantly lower for&#160;<br/>Palestinian children injured during demonstrations in Gaza than for children injured in other circumstances.&#160;<br/>In 2018, 22% of applications were approved, compared with an average approval rate of 75% for other&#160;<br/>cases involving children.1167&#160;<br/>
Even when children have their permit applications to exit Gaza for treatment approved, they are often denied&#160;<br/>the companionship of those most able to support them. In 2018, Israel refused to allow either parent to&#160;<br/>accompany their child for healthcare outside Gaza in the case of 5,256 patient permit applications relating to&#160;<br/>1,821 children.1168<br/>
More stringent security checks, which Israel put in place in November 2015, have also contributed to delays&#160;<br/>in permits being issued. Under the new directives, in order to receive permits male patient companions&#160;<br/>aged&#160;between 16 and 55 and female patient companions aged between 16 and 45 must face more intensive&#160;<br/>security investigations. Further, all “patients may be called for security interrogation as a prerequisite to permit&#160;<br/>processing”, according to the WHO.1169&#160;Indeed, in 2018, the WHO recorded 133 patients and 52 patient&#160;<br/>companions who were called for security interrogation. Human rights organizations have also documented&#160;<br/>many cases where Palestinian patients or their companions were called in for interrogation by the Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities, who attempted to coerce them into collaborating in exchange for treatment. In addition, Israeli&#160;<br/>forces arrested one patient and four patient companions at the checkpoint at the Erez crossing in 2018.1170<br/>
Israeli restrictions on movement have been directly responsible for patient deaths in Gaza and have&#160;<br/>compounded the suffering of ill Palestinians.1171&#160;The WHO reported that 54 patients, 46 of whom had cancer,&#160;<br/>died while waiting for their permits in 2017, which witnessed the lowest approval rate of medical permits –&#160;<br/>

bullets and live ammunition, mostly by snipers. As a result, 214 Palestinians, including 46&#160;children, were killed, and over 36,100, including&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=208></a>54% – between 2012 and 2019.1172&#160;It is possible that some of these deaths might not have occurred but for&#160;<br/>the delays caused by the blockade. In 2019, a survival analysis conducted by the WHO found that “cancer&#160;<br/>patients initially denied or delayed permits to access chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy outside Gaza from&#160;<br/>2015 to 2017 were 1.5 times less likely to survive in the following six months or more, compared to those&#160;<br/>initially approved permits.”&#160;<br/>
The case of Abdul Nasser Al-Yazji, a two-year-old boy who died of cancer whilst waiting for an Israeli permit&#160;<br/>to enter Jerusalem for urgent medical treatment, exemplifies the suffering of thousands of patients and their&#160;<br/>families in the Gaza Strip.&#160;<br/>
<b>ABDUL NASSER AL-YAZJI &#160;&#160;</b><br/>
Abdul Nasser Al-Yazji was just two years old when he died on 28 August 2020 in the Gaza Strip. He&#160;<br/>was diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma of the cervical spine, a rare type of cancer in the neck, in 2019&#160;<br/>when he was 18 months old. His parents were trying to get him to a hospital in East Jerusalem to receive&#160;<br/>specialist treatment, but Israeli authorities did not grant them a permit to leave in time. He had been&#160;<br/>admitted to Abdel Aziz Rantisi Specialist Hospital for Children, which provides oncology services in Gaza,&#160;<br/>where doctors had confirmed he had cancer.<br/>
Abdul&#160;Nasser&#160;Al-Yazji&#160;was&#160;first&#160;given&#160;radiology&#160;treatment&#160;at&#160;the&#160;hospital&#160;in&#160;Gaza,&#160;but&#160;his&#160;condition&#160;did&#160;not&#160;<br/>improve. On 8 February 2020, he was transferred to Al-Ahli Hospital in the West Bank city of Hebron for&#160;<br/>chemotherapy. The Israeli Civil Administration granted permits to him and his mother, Jawaher Al-Yazji,&#160;<br/>to leave the Gaza Strip for two weeks for medical treatment in the West Bank. He had surgery to remove&#160;<br/>the tumour from his neck and he and his mother returned to the Gaza Strip on 22 February 2020.<br/>
Abdul Nasser Al-Yazji’s health condition deteriorated and, on 27 June 2020, he was admitted to Gaza’s&#160;<br/>Abdel Aziz Rantisi Hospital for treatment. Medical examinations and a scan revealed the tumour had&#160;<br/>regrown and that the cancer had spread to the lung. On 8 July 2020, doctors in Gaza recommended&#160;<br/>that he be transferred to Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem, where he could receive urgent and&#160;<br/>specialist medical treatment. The family applied for an exit permit through Erez crossing on the same&#160;<br/>day, but they did not receive an answer before he died around a month later. The family tried reaching&#160;<br/>out to the Civil Administration office but were told that they were not&#160;processing any permits since the&#160;<br/>Ramallah-based Palestinian authorities had cut ties with the Israeli authorities, following Israel’s declared&#160;<br/>plans of annexation in April 2020.<br/>
On&#160;20 August&#160;2020,&#160;while&#160;waiting for&#160;the&#160;permit&#160;to&#160;be&#160;issued,&#160;Jawaher Al-Yazji told&#160;Amnesty&#160;International:<br/>
<i>The Gaza Strip is under siege, meaning we always need to deal with the humiliation of the Israeli&#160;<br/>occupation in order to get medical treatment outside of Gaza. When we went in February, we&#160;<br/>applied to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Palestinian Authority, which works with the Israeli&#160;<br/>Civil Administration. There, we were told that it would take five days to organize the authorization&#160;<br/>documents: two on the Palestinian side and three more days to get an answer from the Israeli&#160;<br/>side. And if you have a security issue, the process will take much longer.</i><br/>
<i>If my son dies at the hospital here, it is not that the cancer has killed him, rather it is the&#160;<br/>occupation. The fact that we cannot even get a proper medical treatment outside of the Gaza Strip&#160;<br/>is what is making people surrender to the illness. Our life is miserable, and it is not getting any&#160;<br/>better. We just pray that one day this injustice will go away.1173&#160;</i><br/>

By implementing this arbitrary permit denial policy, Israel is failing to&#160;fulfil its obligation to ensure access to&#160;<br/>health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis to Palestinians under its effective control,&#160;<br/>violating Palestinians’ right to the highest attainable standard of health and, in the most extreme cases, their&#160;<br/>right to life.&#160;<br/>
In its 2019 review, the CESCR expressed concern regarding Israel’s “lengthy and complicated exit-permit&#160;<br/>system”, in addition to “the very limited availability of healthcare services and the deteriorating quality of&#160;<br/>health-care services in the Gaza Strip due to restrictions on ‘dual use’ items, including essential medical&#160;<br/>equipment”.1174&#160;The CESCR called on Israel to “[i]mmediately lift the blockade and closures on the Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip”. It recommended that Israel “[f]acilitate the entry of essential medical equipment and supplies and the&#160;<br/>movement of medical professionals from and to Gaza” and “[r]eview the medical exit permit system with a&#160;<br/>view to facilitating timely access to all medically recommended healthcare services by residents of Gaza”.1175&#160;<br/>
In addition to restricting the movement of people, Israel also bars Palestinian ambulances travelling from&#160;<br/>the rest of the West Bank from entering East Jerusalem. A procedure known as “back-to-back” transfer&#160;<br/>operates, where Palestinian patients must switch to Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances with&#160;<br/>Israeli-licensed plates at checkpoints before they can be transferred to receive medical care in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem; patients must also receive security clearance from Israeli authorities beforehand.1176&#160;In 2018,&#160;<br/>84% of the 1,462 recorded journeys by Palestinian ambulances requiring entry to East Jerusalem from other&#160;<br/>parts of the West Bank had to follow this procedure, diverting health resources as at least two ambulances&#160;<br/>need to be available for the transfer at checkpoints, and delaying transit.1177&#160;According to data collected&#160;<br/>by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the average delay at checkpoints for “back-to-back” transfer&#160;<br/>procedures in emergency cases was 24 minutes.1178&#160;In 2019, 90% of Palestinian ambulance journeys to&#160;<br/>Jerusalem were required to follow this “back-to-back” transfer procedure.1179<br/>

<a name=210></a>Israel’s territorial division of parts of East Jerusalem, which has left some Palestinian communities beyond&#160;<br/>the fence/wall, and the imposed movement restrictions have hindered the ability of Palestinian residents&#160;<br/>of East Jerusalem in these areas to access adequate primary healthcare services in a timely manner. For&#160;<br/>instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the movement restrictions impeded access to healthcare services&#160;<br/>for Palestinians in East Jerusalem and exacerbated the health crisis.&#160;<br/>
<b>L. M.</b><br/>
L. M. works at a school near the Old City in East Jerusalem and lives with her family in Kufr Aqab, which&#160;<br/>is segregated from the rest of the city by the fence/wall and military checkpoints. She is married with five&#160;<br/>children. The family is forced to live in Kufr Aqab because they do not have permanent residency or the&#160;<br/>necessary permits to allow them to live in East Jerusalem. L. M. must cross through Israeli checkpoints&#160;<br/>to reach work or receive healthcare. She told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>I work at the Schmidt-Schule Jerusalem [school], so living in Jerusalem would be a lot easier… I&#160;<br/>need to get off the bus [from Kufr Aqab] and cross the [Qalandia] checkpoint on foot. Sometimes&#160;<br/>there are so many people waiting at the checkpoint, and it can be suffocating. I now have&#160;<br/>problems with my leg, and it makes it hard and painful to walk sometimes, especially when&#160;<br/>climbing this new bridge they [Israeli authorities] installed at Qalandia checkpoint. I am often late&#160;<br/>for work. I also need to cross whenever I need to go see a doctor. My doctor works at a clinic close&#160;<br/>to the school where I work.1180&#160;&#160;</i><br/>
When the Covid-19 lockdown measures were first imposed in Jerusalem, Palestinian residents of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem living in Kufr Aqab and Shuafat refugee camp, both beyond the fence/wall, could no longer&#160;<br/>access health facilities in the rest of the city. Thousands of them were left with no access to Covid-19&#160;<br/>testing clinics for several weeks.1181&#160;Palestinians had to rely solely on receiving testing and treatment in West&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, where facilities are better equipped to treat certain conditions and illnesses.&#160;<br/>Only after a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court by Adalah and the Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in&#160;<br/>Jerusalem was submitted on 8 April 2020 did Israeli health authorities commit to opening Covid-19 clinics&#160;<br/>and testing centres in Kufr Aqab and Shuafat refugee camps and in Silwan, also in East Jerusalem.1182&#160;The&#160;<br/>three clinics opened on 15 April 2020, nearly two months after the first confirmed cases of Covid-19, and&#160;<br/>were operated by one of the state-mandated medical service providers in Israel. Additional testing facilities&#160;<br/>were opened at a later stage and were run by the Jerusalem Municipality.<br/>
<b>ATTACKS AGAINST HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND MEDICAL FACILITIES<br/></b>Over the years, Israel’s army has repeatedly targeted medical facilities during its military offensives.&#160;<br/>According to the NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians, 147 hospitals and clinics, and 80 ambulances, were&#160;<br/>damaged or destroyed in military offensives on Gaza between 2008 and 2017.1183&#160;In the same period, 145&#160;<br/>medical workers – most of them ambulance drivers – were killed or injured.1184<br/>

<a name=211></a>During the May 2021 military operation, Israel damaged or destroyed 28 health facilities in Gaza, including&#160;<br/>nine hospitals and 19 primary care clinics, according to OCHA.1185&#160;Two of Gaza’s prominent health&#160;<br/>physicians were killed. On 16 May 2021, Israel carried out air strikes against residential buildings and streets&#160;<br/>in Gaza city, which destroyed two residential buildings belonging to the Abu Al-Ouf and Al-Kolaq families,&#160;<br/>killing at least 30 people.1186&#160;Among those killed were Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Al-<br/>Shifa hospital, who was also supervising the ward for severe Covid-19 cases, and Mooein Ahmad Al-Aloul, a&#160;<br/>psychiatric neurologist.1187&#160;The attack blocked Al-Wehda Street, a main road leading to Al-Shifa hospital. The&#160;<br/>next day, an Israeli attack on a building severely damaged the neighbouring medical complex that contained&#160;<br/>the main Covid-19 laboratory.1188<br/>
In another example, the WHO noted unprecedented attacks on the health sector in the context of the Great&#160;<br/>March of Return protests that began in March 2018 along the fence between Gaza and Israel. It reported&#160;<br/>369 attacks against health personnel in the Gaza Strip in 2018, leading to the death of three health workers&#160;<br/>and the injury of 570.1189<br/>
At times of heightened tensions, Israeli security forces have also carried out violent raids on Palestinian&#160;<br/>hospitals and medical personnel in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in some cases preventing&#160;<br/>doctors from providing out urgent medical treatment. According to Medical Aid for Palestinians, between&#160;<br/>October and December 2015, attacks by Israeli security forces resulted in damage to 92 ambulances and&#160;<br/>injuries to 147 medical workers, in addition to eight hospitals being raided.1190&#160;Such raids are usually aimed&#160;<br/>at arresting injured Palestinian protesters whilst they are seeking medical care, and have involved the&#160;<br/>harassment and intimidation of staff with machine guns and stun grenades.1191&#160;<br/>
More recently, during the protests in Sheikh Jarrah in early May 2021,1192&#160;Israeli forces impeded the work&#160;<br/>of Palestinian health workers in East Jerusalem by preventing them from treating the wounded, delaying&#160;<br/>transportation of injured people, and physically assaulting paramedics and ambulances.1193&#160;According to&#160;<br/>the American Near East Refugee Aid, at least 41 healthcare workers were injured in the West Bank, and 21&#160;<br/>medical service vehicles were damaged or confiscated. It also reported physical attacks, harassment and&#160;<br/>restrictions on the movement of healthcare workers, paramedics and ambulances.1194&#160;&#160;<br/>
<b>DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION<br/></b>Across Israel and the OPT, Israel undermines Palestinians’ right to education through underfunding and&#160;<br/>discriminatory urban planning and zoning policies. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, access to education for&#160;<br/>hundreds of thousands of Palestinians is additionally restricted by Israeli violations of freedom of movement&#160;<br/>

<a name=212></a>and military operations targeting schools or conducted in their vicinity. In general, these discriminatory&#160;<br/>policies have a severely detrimental effect on the quality of education provided to Palestinian students,&#160;<br/>and lead to high drop-out rates. Ultimately, they affect Palestinians’ human development, and the ability to&#160;<br/>sustain themselves and their families.&#160;<br/>
Israel has an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to education in both Israel and the OPT under&#160;<br/>international human rights law. In addition, as the occupying power, it has a duty to ensure the right to&#160;<br/>education in the OPT under international humanitarian law including by “facilitat[ing] the proper working of&#160;<br/>all institutions devoted to the care and education of children”.1195<br/>
The public education system in Israel is run by both the central government and local authorities.1196&#160;&#160;<br/>Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jewish Israelis study in separate schools throughout the public education&#160;<br/>system, whereby students are generally sorted into four main streams: three for the Jewish Israeli community&#160;<br/>(secular, religious and ultra-orthodox) and one for the Arabic-speaking community (Palestinian, including&#160;<br/>Bedouin, Druze, and Circassian minorities).1197&#160;The language of instruction for Arabic-speaking communities&#160;<br/>is Arabic,1198&#160;but it is mandatory for them to learn Hebrew.1199<br/>
With the exception of East Jerusalem, Israel does not currently operate or serve the education system for&#160;<br/>Palestinians in the OPT, whereas it does run the education system for Israeli settlers residing in illegal&#160;<br/>settlements across the West Bank. Since 1994, Palestinian authorities, along with private institutions and&#160;<br/>UNRWA, have operated the education system for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.1200&#160;UNRWA&#160;<br/>provides primary and junior secondary schooling education to registered Palestinian refugees in the OPT,&#160;<br/>including East Jerusalem, free of charge, in addition to offering vocational and technical training courses and&#160;<br/>university scholarships to qualified refugee youth.1201<br/>
In East Jerusalem, the Israeli Ministry of Education and the Jerusalem Municipality are responsible for&#160;<br/>providing public education for Palestinian students. Based on an agreement with the Palestinian authorities,&#160;<br/>state schools in East Jerusalem have until recently been solely teaching the Palestinian curriculum. However,&#160;<br/>in recent years, some state schools have adopted the Israeli curriculum in exchange for additional funding.1202&#160;<br/>
Israel discriminates against Palestinian students in Israel and East Jerusalem by underfunding the Arab&#160;<br/>education sector, excluding Arab educators from decision-making bodies, and by failing to provide adequate&#160;<br/>infrastructure and facilities.1203&#160;They receive less funding than their Jewish counterparts at all levels of school&#160;<br/>education. An analysis by the Mossawa Center of the Israeli Ministry of Education’s 2016 budget found that&#160;<br/>Arab students from disadvantaged backgrounds received 30% less funding per learning hours in primary&#160;<br/>education, 50% less funding at the intermediate school level and 75% less funding at the secondary school&#160;<br/>

<a name=213></a>level than Jewish students with the same socio-economic status.1204&#160;In 2016, only 526 classrooms were built&#160;<br/>in Arab localities, compared to 2,171 classrooms built in the Hebrew education system. In 2018, the Israeli&#160;<br/>Ministry of Education recognized the need for merely 2,416 additional classrooms in Arab localities. A year&#160;<br/>later, the Israeli state budget allocated NIS 58.4 million (USD 18.8 million) for the construction of classrooms&#160;<br/>in Arab localities, falling far short of meeting the needs of the community, according to the Mossawa&#160;<br/>Center.1205&#160;At the same time, Arab localities were experiencing a shortage of 7,000 classrooms.1206<br/>
The Israeli authorities’ discriminatory underfunding of Palestinian schools in East Jerusalem is equally clear.&#160;<br/>According to an analysis of the Jerusalem Municipality budget carried out by Haaretz in 2016, “funding for&#160;<br/>the western Jerusalem school [was] immeasurably higher than that of its East Jerusalem counterpart.”1207&#160;<br/>Haaretz found that the Jerusalem Municipality transferred less funding to Palestinian public schools in&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem than the already low budget allocated to them by the Ministry of Education. By contrast,&#160;<br/>Jewish schools received consistently more funding from the municipality than their allocated budget.1208&#160;An&#160;<br/>inquiry by a Meretz party city councillor confirmed these findings: 11 out 17 Palestinian high schools in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem received less than their allocated share of the government’s allocated budget in 2016.1209&#160;<br/>
The underfunding of Palestinian state schools in Israel and annexed East Jerusalem, coupled with&#160;<br/>discriminatory urban planning policies and a discriminatory provision of other essential services described&#160;<br/>elsewhere in this section, lead to classroom overcrowding, lower quality of education and gaps in educational&#160;<br/>attainment between Palestinian and Jewish Israeli students and, ultimately, to a high drop-out rate.1210&#160;<br/>
The situation is particularly severe in the unrecognized villages in the Negev/Naqab where Palestinian&#160;<br/>Bedouins have few or no educational facilities given the government’s refusal to provide such services, based&#160;<br/>on these villages’ lack of official status under discriminatory planning&#160;and zoning policies. Those that exist&#160;<br/>are poorly equipped and severely overcrowded.1211<br/>
Indeed, in its 2020 concluding observations CERD expressed concern about the disproportionately high&#160;<br/>drop-out rates among Bedouin students in the Negev/Naqab and the&#160;significant gaps in the educational&#160;<br/>achievements between Arab students and Jewish students, as well as the shortage of classrooms and&#160;<br/>kindergartens in Bedouin localities.1212&#160;Similar concerns were expressed by the CESCR in 2019 about drop-<br/>out rates and gaps in educational achievements, as well as the shortage of classrooms and kindergartens in&#160;<br/>Bedouin areas.1213<br/>
Similarly, the shortage of classrooms is a major impediment to free education for Palestinians in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem. The Ministry of Education and the Jerusalem Directorate of Education are responsible for&#160;<br/>providing education to 127,198 Palestinian children eligible for school. Of these, as of May 2019, only&#160;<br/>108,598 were actually enrolled in the public education system: 41.1% in 65 public schools in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, with the remainder either enrolled in “recognized but not&#160;official” schools (43.2% of the students&#160;<br/>

<a name=214></a>in 105 schools),1214&#160;or in private schools (15.7% of the students in 79 schools), principally as result of the&#160;<br/>shortage of classroom facilities provided by Israeli authorities.1215&#160;&#160;<br/>
In 2019, public schools in East Jerusalem had a shortage of 1,983 classrooms out of a total shortfall of&#160;<br/>3,800 classrooms in the entire city.1216&#160;Already in February 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court recognized&#160;<br/>the government and municipal authorities’ failure to provide sufficient funding to Palestinian schools&#160;<br/>in East Jerusalem leading to an acute and chronic shortage of classrooms, and held that this violated&#160;<br/>the constitutional right to equal access to education for Palestinian students.1217&#160;The court gave the&#160;<br/>Ministry of Education and the Jerusalem Municipality a five-year period to resolve the shortage of&#160;<br/>classrooms in Palestinian schools in East Jerusalem.1218&#160;Yet, as of May 2019, only 314 new classrooms&#160;<br/>had been completed in East Jerusalem since the court’s ruling. In 2019, the State Comptroller said that&#160;<br/>the municipality had failed in its obligation to provide free access to education due to the shortage of&#160;<br/>classrooms.1219&#160;The Jerusalem Municipality states that it intends to provide an additional 834 classrooms by&#160;<br/>2022. Even if implemented, this would still fail to meet students’ learning needs.1220<br/>
In addition, existing classrooms are often inadequate for teaching.1221&#160;In 2016, 43% of East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>public school classrooms were overcrowded with many located in rented houses.1222&#160;Ir Amim also expressed&#160;<br/>concern that many schools in East Jerusalem lack open spaces and have sub-standard sanitary conditions&#160;<br/>due to a shortage of cleaning staff and unavailability of sanitation supplies.1223<br/>
In parallel with underfunding and blatant neglect, Israeli discriminatory practices aimed at coercing&#160;<br/>Palestinians in East Jerusalem to leave the city have also a severe impact on their right to education. Israel&#160;<br/>extends its policy of home and structure demolitions in East Jerusalem to Palestinian schools constructed&#160;<br/>without building permits, which as detailed above are nearly impossible to obtain. According to the UN, in&#160;<br/>2019, eight schools in East Jerusalem had pending “stop work” or demolition orders issued against them,&#160;<br/>which would affect around 1,100 students if implemented.1224&#160;In addition, movement restrictions in different&#160;<br/>parts of East Jerusalem impede access to education for children living in the communities isolated by the&#160;<br/>fence/wall, and expose them to a risk of harassment, attacks and/or arrest by Israeli soldiers.&#160;<br/>
The combined effect of inadequate teaching conditions, restrictions on movement and high poverty rates&#160;<br/>means that over 14% of Palestinian children in East Jerusalem were not enrolled in any educational&#160;<br/>institution in 2019.1225&#160;In 2020, the number of Palestinian children not registered in any formal education&#160;<br/>rose to 30% mainly due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, exposing the fragility of the&#160;<br/>education system in East Jerusalem,1226&#160;and disparities between Palestinian and Jewish Israeli children’s&#160;<br/>

<a name=215></a>accessibility to distance learning through the availability of a computer and internet account at home.1227&#160;<br/>Further, approximately a third of Palestinian adolescents in Jerusalem do not complete 12 years of schooling&#160;<br/>compared to a drop-out rate for Jewish Israeli students in the city of an estimated 1.5%.1228<br/>
As stated above, in May 2018, the Israeli government announced that it would invest NIS 1.85 billion in&#160;<br/>infrastructure and services in East Jerusalem to address its residents’ socio-economic needs. According to Ir&#160;<br/>Amim, however, 43.4% of the education budget intended to reduce gaps between West and East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>is conditioned on Palestinian schools’ adoption of the Israeli curriculum.1229&#160;This strategy was confirmed by&#160;<br/>the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the OPT when he expressed concern in 2019&#160;<br/>that Israel was attempting to further erode Palestinian identity and autonomy by persuading schools in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem to change the curriculum in return for more investment.1230<br/>
Israeli discriminatory urban planning policies aimed at coercing forcible transfers, severe restrictions on&#160;<br/>movement and repeated military attacks are the primary reasons why Palestinian students face obstacles&#160;<br/>in accessing education in the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in addition to the Palestinian&#160;<br/>authorities’ failure to sufficiently prioritize education and an underfunding&#160;crisis.1231&#160;This has resulted in a&#160;<br/>severe shortage of learning facilities.1232<br/>
In 2019, 43 Palestinian schools in Area C of the West Bank were subject to demolition or “stop work” orders&#160;<br/>due to lack of permits, affecting around 4,100 students and hindering any maintenance or expansion of&#160;<br/>school infrastructure.1233&#160;In general, many schools in Area C do not meet safety and well-being standards.&#160;<br/>They are located in rented houses, or in caravans, and in some cases are built out of tyres. Many lack&#160;<br/>sanitation facilities and play areas, and have water leakages, and broken windows. In addition, Palestinian&#160;<br/>children in more than one third of Area C lack access to primary schools, with many having to walk long&#160;<br/>distances, exposing them to violence and harassment by Israeli settlers1234&#160;and soldiers who rarely intervene&#160;<br/>to stop such attacks. As a result, some families adopt “negative coping mechanisms” and take their children&#160;<br/>out of school.1235<br/>
More broadly, in 2018, the UN documented 118 incidents of Israeli actions interfering with the right to&#160;<br/>education in the OPT, affecting 23,188 children and impacting their access to education.1236&#160;More than half&#160;<br/>of these incidents related to the firing of live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades into or near schools&#160;<br/>by Israeli forces, while the other incidents pertained to the threat of demolition of schools, closures, settler&#160;<br/>violence and harassment at military checkpoints.1237<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=216></a>Since 2008, four major rounds of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip have had a particularly&#160;<br/>devastating impact on the right to education of Palestinians living there. For example, during the 2014&#160;<br/>Israeli military operation in Gaza, nearly 615 educational facilities, including kindergartens, schools, and&#160;<br/>tertiary education institutions were damaged or destroyed, affecting 350,000 students, according to the UN&#160;<br/>Development Programme.1238&#160;By February 2017, the UNDP programme had completed the rehabilitation&#160;<br/>and reconstruction of 37 educational facilities, benefiting 88,311 students.1239&#160;The May 2021 military&#160;<br/>offensive further exacerbated Gaza’s education crisis, resulting in 331 damaged educational facilities.12340&#160;&#160;<br/>Together with disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Israeli violations placed some 18,089 Gazan&#160;<br/>children at risk of dropping out from school.1241<br/>
Over the years, repeated Israeli air strikes on schools, and restrictions under the “dual use” policy (see&#160;<br/>section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human development”) preventing the entry of construction&#160;<br/>materials necessary for the reconstruction and repair of education facilities, have caused a serious shortage&#160;<br/>of classrooms. This has led to schools operating on a shift basis. For example, out of 274 UNRWA schools&#160;<br/>across the Gaza Strip, 84 operate on a single-shift basis, 177 on a double-shift basis, and 13 on a triple-<br/>shift&#160;basis.1242<br/>
In addition, thousands of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been unable to access higher education outside&#160;<br/>Gaza, including in the West Bank, since Israel imposed its blockade,1243&#160;which not only violates their right to&#160;<br/>education but also may have lifelong consequences for their ability to support themselves and their families.&#160;<br/>The restrictions on access to education come on top of the already severely limited opportunities through&#160;<br/>which Palestinians can generate an income and access livelihood opportunities. There are a number of&#160;<br/>important programmes that continue to be unavailable in Gaza, including medical engineering and some&#160;<br/>doctoral programmes.1244&#160;The combined impact of such restrictions places Palestinians in Gaza at risk of&#160;<br/>ongoing and deepening poverty and deprivation, suppressing their human potential.<br/>
Indeed, in its 2019 review, the CESCR expressed concern about the blanket ban on allowing Gazan&#160;<br/>students to leave Gaza to attend university imposed since 2014, and concluded that the “dual-use” policy&#160;<br/>undermines the ability of students in the Gaza Strip to enjoy their right&#160;to education, “particularly in the fields&#160;<br/>of science and engineering, and the benefits of scientific progress and&#160;its applications due to the lack of&#160;<br/>essential education materials and equipment”.1245<br/>
More broadly, the CESCR expressed concern at Israeli restrictions on Palestinians’ access to education in the&#160;<br/>OPT due to a shortage of school facilities in the OPT resulting from demolition orders, difficulties in obtaining&#160;<br/>building permits and importing construction materials under the “dual-use” policy; searches of Palestinian&#160;<br/>schools by Israeli security forces; repeated harassment and threats against teachers and students by both&#160;<br/>Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers at checkpoints or along roads.1246<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=217></a><b>5.6 A SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION AND DOMINATION&#160;<br/></b>As this chapter has demonstrated, Israel has created and maintains an institutionalized regime of systematic&#160;<br/>oppression and domination over Palestinians, enforced across different domains through reinforcing&#160;<br/>discriminatory laws, policies and practices that, when seen as a totality, control virtually every aspect of&#160;<br/>Palestinians’ lives and routinely violates their human rights. Israel’s control over Palestinians within Israel,&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, and Gaza, and over the right of return of Palestinian refugees,&#160;<br/>manifests itself differently but consistently has the same purpose of dominating and oppressing Palestinians&#160;<br/>for the benefit of Jewish Israelis, both generally and within the same&#160;areas, who are privileged under Israeli&#160;<br/>civil law regardless of where they reside. The discrimination and segregation are self-evidently systematic as&#160;<br/>it is realized in law, policy and practice.<br/>
Since its establishment in 1948, the State of Israel has created and continues to maintain a system designed&#160;<br/>to ensure an overwhelming Jewish majority with access to and benefiting from the maximum amount of&#160;<br/>territory, land, and resources acquired or controlled for the benefit of&#160;Jewish Israelis while restricting the&#160;<br/>rights of Palestinians to challenge this dispossession. This system has been applied wherever Israel has&#160;<br/>exercised effective control over territory and land or over the exercise of the rights of Palestinians. It is&#160;<br/>realized in law, policy and practice, and reflected in the discourse of the state from its establishment and&#160;<br/>until this day.&#160;<br/>
While laws and policies define the State of Israel as democratic, this&#160;chapter has shown that the regime&#160;<br/>in Israel and the OPT is structurally built and maintained to benefit Jewish Israelis, whilst dispossessing&#160;<br/>Palestinians, of rights and preventing them from challenging the regime of systematic oppression and&#160;<br/>domination.&#160;<br/>
While international law applies differently to the situations in Israel and in the OPT, this fact does not excuse&#160;<br/>prohibited discrimination against Palestinians in any of the areas under Israel’s control. Israel’s treatment&#160;<br/>of Palestinians inside Israel is governed by international human rights law, to the exclusion of international&#160;<br/>humanitarian law. In the OPT, Israel’s conduct is bound both by the rules of international humanitarian law&#160;<br/>relevant to military occupation (law of occupation) and its obligations under international human rights law.&#160;<br/>The law of occupation allows, and in some cases requires, differential treatment between nationals of the&#160;<br/>occupying power and the population of the occupied territory. However, it does not allow the occupying&#160;<br/>power to do this where the intention is to establish or maintain a regime of systematic racial oppression and&#160;<br/>domination (see section 4.7 “Apartheid in situations of belligerent occupation”). Given the reality of over five&#160;<br/>decades of annexation, illegal settlements and dispossession of the occupied population, there is no doubt&#160;<br/>that Israel’s differential treatment Palestinians in the OPT does not adhere to the law of occupation. In fact,&#160;<br/>it is a serious and flagrant violation of its obligations under international human rights law and international&#160;<br/>humanitarian law.<br/>
This chapter illustrates how, through fragmentation and segregation, denial of Palestinians’ right to equal&#160;<br/>nationality and status; systematic violation of their rights to freedom of&#160;movement, family unification and&#160;<br/>return to their country and their homes; and blocking their ownership of and access to land, the State of&#160;<br/>Israel subjects Palestinians to systematic oppression and domination and denies them human rights. In&#160;<br/>order to ensure Jewish domination over land and territory, Israel created a land acquisition and allocation&#160;<br/>regime consisting of legislation, reinterpretation of existing British and Ottoman laws, governmental and&#160;<br/>semi-governmental land institutions, and a supportive judiciary that enabled land dispossession and&#160;<br/>discriminatory reallocation of such lands across all territories under its control. The result has been the&#160;<br/>deliberate impoverishment of the Palestinian population both within Israel and in the OPT.&#160;<br/>
The continuing forced displacement of a majority of Palestinians from their land and property in 1947-49&#160;<br/>and subsequently in 1967; the forced deportations, forcible transfers and arbitrary restrictions on their&#160;<br/>freedom of movement; the denial of nationality and the right of return; the racialized and discriminatory&#160;<br/>dispossession of their lands and property; and the subsequent discriminatory allocation of and access to&#160;<br/>national resources (including land, housing and water) combine to hinder Palestinians’ current enjoyment&#160;<br/>of their rights, including to access to livelihood, employment, healthcare, food security, water and sanitation,&#160;<br/>

<a name=218></a>and education opportunities. They ensure that Palestinians cannot as individuals or communities enjoy a&#160;<br/>status equal to that of Jewish Israelis in Israel, the OPT and other situations where Israel exercises control&#160;<br/>over Palestinians’ enjoyment of their rights, particularly the right of return.<br/>
While Palestinian citizens of Israel can vote in national elections, in practice their right to political&#160;<br/>participation is limited and they continue to be perceived as the “enemy within”. However, this is not the&#160;<br/>primary way in which they have been subjected to segregation, oppression and domination by Israel. As&#160;<br/>this chapter has shown, Palestinian citizens of Israel were systematically dispossessed of land, property and&#160;<br/>housing through many of the same practices which are currently applied against Palestinians in the OPT and&#160;<br/>continue to be largely denied access to public land for development&#160;and to natural and financial resources&#160;<br/>on the basis of their racial and national status under Israeli law. This has led directly to the impoverishment&#160;<br/>and alienation of Palestinian communities and their effective exclusion from civil and political life. They have&#160;<br/>no effective recourse to the courts for redress of these violations.&#160;<br/>
This regime of systematic oppression and domination is of a prolonged and sustained nature: many of the&#160;<br/>discriminatory laws, policies and practices in Israel were brought in during the years following the creation of&#160;<br/>the State of Israel in 1948 and have been applied to the OPT since 1967. These laws, policies and practices&#160;<br/>are blatantly discriminatory on the basis of membership of racial groups,1247&#160;particularly cruel in their&#160;<br/>impact on the lives of Palestinians and are deliberately applied as a matter of official policy to Palestinians&#160;<br/>in Israel and the OPT, and to Palestinian refugees living outside Israel and the OPT. Almost all of Israel’s&#160;<br/>civilian administration and military authorities, as well as quasi-governmental institutions, are involved in the&#160;<br/>enforcement of this regime of discrimination against and segregation of Palestinians, across Israel and the&#160;<br/>OPT and against Palestinian refugees and their descendants outside Israel and the OPT.&#160;<br/>
The intention to maintain this regime can be inferred from the prolonged nature of the cruel and&#160;<br/>discriminatory treatment, which indicates the non-accidental nature of the oppression and domination&#160;<br/>perpetrated against Palestinians, and from statements by successive Israeli political leaders of various&#160;<br/>political parties, who have emphasized the overarching objective of maintaining Israel’s identity as a Jewish&#160;<br/>state and the fact that this is perceived to require preventing Palestinians from full enjoyment of equal rights.&#160;<br/>This regime of oppression and domination was clearly crystallized in the nation state law adopted in 2018&#160;<br/>that constitutionally enshrined racial discrimination against non-Jewish people in Israel and the OPT. The&#160;<br/>essence of this system has also been communicated in numerous statements by senior civilian and military&#160;<br/>officials, who have promoted, maintained and enforced the institutionalized regime of systematic oppression&#160;<br/>and domination of Palestinians, being fully aware of, and therefore fully responsible for, the atrocious&#160;<br/>consequences the regime has for the Palestinian population.&#160;<br/>
The racial discrimination against and segregation of Palestinians is the result of deliberate government&#160;<br/>policy. The regular violations of Palestinians’ rights are not accidental repetitions of offences, but part of an&#160;<br/>institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination.<br/>
As described above apartheid as condemned by the ICERD and public international law constitutes, at&#160;<br/>the very least, the (creation and) maintenance of a system or institutionalized regime of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination by one racial group over another. This chapter has documented a system of laws, policies and&#160;<br/>practices that ensure the prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment of Palestinians with the intention of&#160;<br/>controlling them and therefore demonstrates that Israel has committed the international wrong of apartheid&#160;<br/>against the Palestinian people. This chapter has also demonstrated that Israel has committed serious&#160;<br/>violations of human rights within the context of this regime of systematic oppression and domination with the&#160;<br/>goal of maintaining it. These acts include murder and unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, torture, forcible&#160;<br/>transfer (which was partly documented in this chapter) and other grave violations of international human&#160;<br/>rights and international humanitarian law. Many of these acts constitute inhuman and inhumane acts as&#160;<br/>prohibited by respectively the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. These are assessed further in the&#160;<br/>following chapter.&#160;<br/>
1247.&#160;In section 5.2 “Palestinians and Jewish Israelis as racial groups”, Amnesty International showed that Jewish Israelis and Palestinians&#160;<br/>

<b>ACTS AGAINST PALESTINIANS&#160;&#160;</b><br/>
In the process of creating and maintaining the system of oppression and domination over Palestinians&#160;<br/>described above, individuals, acting on behalf of the State of Israel, have committed inhuman and inhumane&#160;<br/>acts as proscribed by respectively the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. An assessment of&#160;<br/>these violations is relevant to determining whether the crime of apartheid has been committed in Israel and&#160;<br/>the OPT as each of these serious human rights violations would constitute the crime against humanity of&#160;<br/>apartheid if committed in the necessary context. The analysis provided in this chapter gives an overview of&#160;<br/>some of the serious human rights violations committed within the context of the system of oppression and&#160;<br/>domination over Palestinians to determine whether they amount to inhuman or inhumane acts. It also assists&#160;<br/>in determining whether there has been the commission of a widespread or systematic attack on the civilian&#160;<br/>population with the intention of creating or maintaining a system of oppression and domination.<br/>
Amnesty International has examined specifically the inhuman or inhumane acts of forcible transfer,&#160;<br/>administrative detention, torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic rights and&#160;<br/>freedoms or persecution committed against the Palestinian population in Israel and the OPT, and that are&#160;<br/>associated with and enforce the system of discriminatory laws, policies and practices already discussed&#160;<br/>in detail above. The set of acts analysed below is not exhaustive and does not imply that Israel is not&#160;<br/>responsible for committing other inhuman or inhumane acts as defined&#160;under respectively the Apartheid&#160;<br/>Convention and the Rome Statute.<br/>
These proscribed actions have been analysed because they demonstrate most starkly the inhuman&#160;<br/>treatment meted out to Palestinians and illustrate other violations perpetrated against Palestinians in the&#160;<br/>territories under Israel’s effective control.<br/>
<b>6.1 FORCIBLE TRANSFER &#160;<br/>6.1.1 RELEVANT CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW&#160;<br/></b>Article 7(1)(d) of the Rome Statute criminalizes “deportation or forcible transfer of population” as a crime&#160;<br/>against humanity. Forcible transfer occurs when there is displacement within the territory of one state,&#160;<br/>whereas deportation presumes displacement beyond state borders.1248&#160;The crime against humanity of&#160;<br/>forcible transfer is defined in the Rome Statute as the “forced displacement of the persons concerned by&#160;<br/>expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted&#160;<br/>under international law”.1249&#160;The Apartheid Convention criminalizes “the deliberate creation of conditions&#160;<br/>

<a name=220></a>preventing the full development of such a group or groups”, for example, through measures that make it&#160;<br/>impossible to remain in a given community.1250<br/>
As provided by the Rome Statute, and as has been interpreted by ad hoc international criminal tribunals,&#160;<br/>the term “forced” in the context of forcible transfer is not confined to&#160;expulsions or “physical force”. It&#160;<br/>also includes “threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention,&#160;<br/>psychological oppression or abuse of power against such person or persons or another person, or by&#160;<br/>taking advantage of a coercive environment”,1251&#160;or “factors other than force itself [that] may render an&#160;<br/>act involuntary”.1252&#160;The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has also ruled&#160;<br/>that the creation of adverse living conditions, such as cutting off water, electricity and telephone services,&#160;<br/>harassment, arrests and house searches, that made it impossible for those targeted to remain and induced&#160;<br/>their movement, constitutes forcible transfer.1253<br/>
A key criterion for assessing the coercive and arbitrary nature of the transfer is the absence of a “genuine&#160;<br/>wish to leave”1254&#160;or a “genuine choice to go”1255&#160;by the individuals displaced from the area in which they&#160;<br/>are lawfully present. The ICTY has clarified that the lawful presence&#160;requisite “is intended to exclude only&#160;<br/>those situations where the individuals are occupying houses or premises unlawfully or illegally and not to&#160;<br/>impose a requirement for ‘residency’ to be demonstrated as a legal standard.”1256&#160;Thus, the ICTY case law&#160;<br/>has primarily focused on the coercive nature of the “unlawful transfer”, which is “crucial for diminishing the&#160;<br/>importance of examining the&#160;<i>lawfulness</i>&#160;of the place of residence from which persons are removed”.1257<br/>
Additionally, the forcible transfer or deportation of the population of an occupied territory, either within or&#160;<br/>outside the occupied territory, may constitute a war crime under Article 8(2)(a)(vii) of the Rome Statute.&#160;<br/>Forcible transfer is absolutely prohibited under international humanitarian law.1258&#160;Only “imperative military&#160;<br/>reasons” or the protection of the displaced population could justify their partial or total transfer,1259&#160;which&#160;<br/>must be limited by the “temporariness of the transfer” and the right of the displaced population to return&#160;<br/>immediately upon the end of hostilities.1260<br/>
<b>6.1.2 ISRAELI POLICIES AND PRACTICES&#160;<br/>HOME AND PROPERTY DEMOLITIONS&#160;<br/></b>Across Israel and the OPT, Israel’s destruction of Palestinian homes, agricultural land and other property&#160;<br/>is intricately linked with Israel’s long- standing policy of land appropriation for the benefit of its Jewish&#160;<br/>population.

<a name=221></a>directly linked to livelihoods, on grounds of the lack of building permits.1261&#160;This policy coerces the transfer&#160;<br/>of Palestinians or leaves many facing the threat of home demolition and displacement. The effect is to&#160;<br/>concentrate Palestinians into small enclaves and reduce their demographic presence and future growth,&#160;<br/>while disproportionally favouring the Jewish Israeli population in these areas.<br/>
As analysed above, although the legal system applied by Israel to Palestinians in Israel and East Jerusalem&#160;<br/>differs from that imposed on Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank, Israeli authorities have enforced&#160;<br/>a discriminatory and to a large extent similar planning and building regime against Palestinians in these&#160;<br/>communities, where the pattern has a similar logic and aims using slightly different means (see section&#160;<br/>5.4.4 “A discriminatory planning and zoning system”). The restrictive and discriminatory planning laws and&#160;<br/>policies in Israel, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank have made it extremely difficult or virtually&#160;<br/>impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits from the Israeli authorities, leaving many of them with&#160;<br/>little choice but to build without permits, risking home demolitions and subsequent forced displacement.&#160;<br/>
Since 1948, Israel has demolished tens of thousands of Palestinian homes and other properties across&#160;<br/>all areas under its jurisdiction and effective control.1262&#160;This includes the destruction of more than 500&#160;<br/>Palestinian villages in what became Israel following the 1947-49 conflict. Those affected are some of&#160;<br/>the poorest and most marginalized communities in both Israeli and Palestinian society, often refugees or&#160;<br/>internally displaced persons, who are forced to rely on family, friends and humanitarian actors for shelter&#160;<br/>and livelihoods.1263&#160;Homes and other property built with the assistance of foreign donors have been amongst&#160;<br/>those targeted for demolitions.<br/>
Demolitions continue today and are usually carried out for three main reasons: unlicensed building, alleged&#160;<br/>military or security needs or as punishment. As shown above (see section 5.4.4 “Discriminatory urban planning&#160;<br/>and zoning system”), in the Negev/Naqab, where Israeli authorities refuse to recognize 35 Bedouin villages,&#160;<br/>between 2013 and 2018 there were 7,298 demolitions in the Palestinian Bedouin communities over lack&#160;<br/>of permits, of which 6,100 were “self-demolitions”, in which owners destroy their own homes or structures&#160;<br/>that have demolition orders against them in order to avoid paying heavy fines and the cost of demolition to&#160;<br/>the Israeli authorities,1264&#160;and 1,974 were of structures intended for residential purposes, according to the&#160;<br/>Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality.1265&#160;According to the Ministry of Public Security, demolitions of&#160;<br/>Bedouin homes in the Negev/Naqab tripled between 2013 and 2017.1266&#160;In 2019 alone, 2,241 structures were&#160;<br/>demolished, either by state forces or by the owners after they received the demolition order or a warning. This&#160;<br/>represented an increase of 146% compared to the previous year, and a 221% increase compared to 2013.1267<br/>
In East Jerusalem, Israeli authorities demolished 1,360 structures, displacing 2,462 people, over the lack&#160;<br/>of building permits, from 1 January 2009 to 5 August 2020, according to OCHA.1268&#160;B’Tselem, for its part,&#160;<br/>recorded the demolition of 1,632 structures, including 1,136 housing structures and 496 non-residential&#160;<br/>structures in East Jerusalem between 1 January 2004 and 31 July 2021, which in total displaced 3,659&#160;<br/>Palestinians.1269&#160;Such demolitions have been more widespread in Area C of the West Bank, where, between&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=222></a>1 January 2009 and 12 August 2020, Israeli authorities demolished or seized 5,339 structures over the lack&#160;<br/>of building permits and as a result 7,548 people were displaced.1270<br/>
In the case of unlicensed building, Israeli authorities have consistently maintained that the demolition of&#160;<br/>Palestinian houses is based on planning considerations and carried out in accordance with the applicable&#160;<br/>law. When Palestinians build houses illegally (because they cannot obtain planning and building permits),1271&#160;<br/>the houses are destroyed. However, Israeli officials have discriminated in the application of planning laws&#160;<br/>and policies in the Negev/Naqab in Israel, East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank. They strictly&#160;<br/>enforce planning prohibitions where Palestinian houses are built and freely allow amendments to plans to&#160;<br/>promote development where Israeli authorities are setting up Jewish cities in Israel or Israeli settlements&#160;<br/>in the OPT.1272&#160;For instance, the Israeli Civil Administration has enforced sanctions against construction&#160;<br/>without permits in Area C of the occupied West Bank in a discriminatory manner, issuing demolition orders&#160;<br/>against thousands of Palestinian homes and other structures, but issuing them less often in relation to&#160;<br/>structures built without permits by Israeli settlers.1273&#160;For example, between 1988 and 2014, the Israeli Civil&#160;<br/>Administration issued 14,087 demolition orders against Palestinian structures in Area C and executed nearly&#160;<br/>20% of them. In the same period, it issued 6,948 demolition orders against structures in Israeli settlements,&#160;<br/>and executed 12% of them.1274<br/>
Forced evictions and demolitions are usually carried out by demolition crews, accompanied by security&#160;<br/>officials, who may arrive at any time, giving families little notice or opportunity to remove their possessions.&#160;<br/>Recent years have shown a spike in the rate of “self-demolitions”.1275<br/>
Israel carries out its policy of home and structure demolitions based on the lack of building permits in the&#160;<br/>context of other discriminatory laws and policies it applies to Palestinians. Some of these laws relate to the&#160;<br/>planning and building regimes, such as the refusal to connect these communities to water and sanitation&#160;<br/>networks or electricity grids, or provide them with schools or healthcare centres, thereby precluding&#160;<br/>Palestinians from meaningfully exercising their rights to livelihood, adequate housing and residence. Other&#160;<br/>policies are designed and relate to maintaining a regime of domination over Palestinians, such as Israel’s&#160;<br/>severe restrictions on movement in the OPT, its declaration of adjacent lands as closed military areas or&#160;<br/>“firing zones”, its expansion of settlements and its failure to protect the Palestinian population against Israeli&#160;<br/>settlers’ attacks and intimidation. Together, these policies create a coercive environment with the aim of&#160;<br/>forcing Palestinians in these communities to leave their homes to ensure a Jewish demographic majority&#160;<br/>and retain Israeli control over these areas and allow for the creation and expansion of Jewish localities and&#160;<br/>settlements, as shown above. Many Palestinians from East Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank have left&#160;<br/>their homes to areas adjacent to their original homes or to areas under the nominal administrative control of&#160;<br/>the Palestinian authorities.&#160;<br/>
Within the OPT, Israel has also pursued other policies that have resulted in systematic punitive home&#160;<br/>demolitions. Since 1967, Israel has been punitively demolishing homes of families of Palestinians suspected&#160;<br/>or convicted of attacks against Israeli soldiers or civilians across the OPT or in Israel, regardless of whether&#160;<br/>they are the owners of the property or not.1276&#160;Israel’s military claims that the policy is carried out for&#160;<br/>security and military purposes to deter other attacks, yet it stopped using the policy for lack of evidence&#160;<br/>

The Supreme Court of Israel rubber-stamped the punitive home demolitions policy in 2014, and left&#160;<br/>the administrative practice to be carried out at the discretion of the Military Commander, without court&#160;<br/>supervision or proceedings.1278&#160;However, this policy has been undoubtedly punitive in nature and&#160;<br/>constitutes collective punishment, which is expressly prohibited under international law.1279&#160;According to&#160;<br/>B’Tselem, Israel punitively demolished 1,012 houses and sealed seven others between 1 January 2001&#160;<br/>and 21 August 2020, effectively leaving 4,548 people homeless.1280<br/>
Additionally, the Israeli army has conducted several military operations in the OPT over the years,&#160;<br/>which have also resulted in widespread home demolitions and the forced displacement of thousands&#160;<br/>of Palestinians.1281&#160;Some of these attacks involved air strikes deliberately targeting inhabited residential&#160;<br/>buildings and family homes.1282&#160;In the Gaza Strip, Israel’s military operation in 2014 destroyed or rendered&#160;<br/>uninhabitable about 18,000 housing units and a further 37,650 housing units were damaged (see&#160;<br/>section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human development”).1283&#160;With 485,000 people – or 28% of&#160;<br/>Gaza’s population – displaced at the peak of the hostilities, the operation resulted in the largest internal&#160;<br/>displacement in the OPT since 1967, leaving 108,000 people homeless, according to the UN. As of&#160;<br/>February 2019, over 12,300 of these people were still displaced.1284&#160;In its military operation in the Gaza&#160;<br/>Strip between 10 and 21 May 2021, Israel destroyed or severely damaged 2,291 housing and commercial&#160;<br/>units (see section 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’ human development”),1285&#160;and, at the height of the&#160;<br/>violence, over 113,000 Gazans were internally displaced.1286<br/>

<a name=224></a>destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations”1287&#160;– even with ample forewarning. In&#160;<br/>fact, “extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified&#160;by military necessity and carried out&#160;<br/>unlawfully and wantonly,” is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and is a war crime.1288<br/>
The following case studies of home demolitions in Umm Al-Hiran in the Negev/Naqab, Silwan in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and Khirbet Khumsa and Khan al-Ahmar in Area C of the West Bank are emblematic of Israel’s&#160;<br/>long-standing policies towards Palestinians in Israel and the OPT. They illustrate the interplay between&#160;<br/>discriminatory zoning and building regimes, land appropriation policies enabled by a supportive judiciary,&#160;<br/>and the deliberate creation of a coercive environment through the denial of basic services, on the one hand,&#160;<br/>and continued attacks and harassment by settlers and security forces, on the other – all intended to minimize&#160;<br/>Palestinian presence and establish Jewish domination and control over specific areas of strategic importance.&#160;<br/>
<b>UMM AL-HIRAN &#160;</b><br/>
Umm Al-Hiran is one of the 35 unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Negev/Naqab, located in the&#160;<br/>north-east of the region and home to 350 Palestinians.1289&#160;These Bedouin families were displaced from&#160;<br/>their original land in Wadi Zubala in the western Negev/Naqab following the establishment of the State&#160;<br/>of Israel. The original lands of the village had been purchased in 1940 by the JNF/KKL, which allocated&#160;<br/>part of the lands to the Jewish kibbutz of Shuval, which was established in 1946.1290&#160;In 1952, the Israeli&#160;<br/>army seized the lands of the village and ordered the residents to leave. They were never allowed to&#160;<br/>return and experienced expulsion twice again until their final resettlement in Umm Al-Hiran in 1956.1291&#160;&#160;<br/>
For decades, the residents of Umm Al-Hiran lived in dire socio-economic conditions and lacked basic&#160;<br/>services, while waiting to return to their original place of residence or gain legal recognition of their&#160;<br/>current location. However, in 2003, the National Council for Planning and Building approved the&#160;<br/>founding of the Jewish settlement Hiran in place of the village of Umm Al-Hiran. The villagers began to&#160;<br/>receive eviction and demolition orders the following year.1292<br/>
In 2009, Israeli authorities approved plans to use Umm Al-Hiran’s land to build a town “with institutions&#160;<br/>intended to serve the religious Jewish community” to be named Hiran.1293&#160;In May 2015, the Supreme&#160;<br/>Court of Israel approved the plan and ruled that the land belongs to the state and that it is entitled to&#160;<br/>withdraw its permission for Umm Al-Hiran inhabitants to live there.1294&#160;<br/>
After receiving demolition and eviction orders, the residents initiated legal proceedings to cancel the&#160;<br/>orders before an Israeli magistrates’ court.1295&#160;During the proceedings and in their briefs, the residents&#160;<br/>raised several alternatives to the destruction of their village and their subsequent displacement.

<a name=225></a>included the legal recognition of their village in its current location instead of the building of a Jewish&#160;<br/>locality; their village becoming part of the future Hiran locality; and their return to their original lands.&#160;<br/>The different legal proceedings pertaining to Umm Al-Hiran and the eviction orders lasted 13 years.&#160;<br/>Throughout the proceedings, Israeli authorities rejected all proposals and retained the legal argument&#160;<br/>that the Bedouin were trespassers on state lands.1296<br/>
The legal proceedings ended on 5 May 2015 when the Israeli Supreme Court dismissed the petition&#160;<br/>and ordered the eviction of the village in the same month.1297&#160;The ruling was contingent on an&#160;<br/>alternative housing solution for the residents. Israeli authorities proposed the nearby state-planned&#160;<br/>township of Hura, 8km south-west of Umm Al-Hiran, as the alternative. However, this option was&#160;<br/>not viable, as Hura was already overcrowded and suffering a serious housing shortage for its own&#160;<br/>residents.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities began work on the new Jewish locality of Hiran in 2015.1298&#160;Following&#160;<br/>the court decision in May 2015, the Israeli authorities ploughed the&#160;agricultural fields of Umm Al-Hiran&#160;<br/>and destroyed the crops. In January 2016, the court rejected a request to appeal its decision.&#160;<br/>
In 2017, Adalah uncovered a document from Hiran’s cooperative association’s bylaws that said its&#160;<br/>“admissions committee” would permit the admittance of individuals to the town “if they meet the&#160;<br/>following qualifications: a Jewish Israeli citizen or permanent resident of Israel who observes the Torah&#160;<br/>and commandments according to Orthodox Jewish value.”1299<br/>
On 18 January 2017, the authorities began evictions. A large number of Israeli police, with bulldozers&#160;<br/>and other special vehicles, stormed the village of Umm Al-Hiran before dawn. They encircled the area,&#160;<br/>blocked the entry and exit of people and vehicles, and demolished eight houses, arresting and injuring&#160;<br/>tens of residents. One resident, Ya’qub Abu Al-Qia’an, a 50-year-old teacher, was unlawfully killed (see&#160;<br/>section 6.3.2 “Israeli policies and practices”).1300<br/>
According to the Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality, some of the residents who had already&#160;<br/>been evicted after their homes were destroyed sought to build homes and reside in Hura township.&#160;<br/>
The plan to build the Jewish community of Hiran is supported by the JNF/KKL and key NGOs, including&#160;<br/>the OR Movement.1301&#160;According to the OR Movement’s website, it hopes to settle up to 2,400 families,&#160;<br/>or some 10,000 residents, in Hiran.1302&#160;The website also states that Hiran has “received construction&#160;<br/>approval from all institutions and authorities, and is now in the process of construction of the community&#160;<br/>in practice.” It further states that over 30 families are currently living in a nearby town waiting to move&#160;<br/>into Hiran once it is built.1303<br/>

<b>SILWAN &#160;</b><br/>
As mentioned above,1304&#160;Silwan is a very densely populated part of East Jerusalem lying to the south of&#160;<br/>the Old City, with 40,000 to 45,000 Palestinians1305&#160;living in an area of merely 5.5km2. For decades, it has&#160;<br/>been the target of home demolitions under Israel’s discriminatory policies relating to planning and building&#160;<br/>in Jerusalem. Silwan comprises nine neighbourhoods, including Ras Al-Amoud, Wadi Yasul, Wadi Hilweh&#160;<br/>and Al-Bustan.1306&#160;Since the 1980s, it has seen intense levels of settler activity due to its strategic location.<br/>

Palestinian land for Jewish settlement”.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=227></a>The increase in the Palestinian population over the decades and the impediments precluding any&#160;<br/>development create unbearable living conditions that amount to a coercive environment. Coupled&#160;<br/>with this, Israeli authorities have historically neglected Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem,&#160;<br/>deliberately avoiding investing in infrastructure and services, including roads, pavements, water and&#160;<br/>sewerage systems, schools and cultural institutions (see sections 5.5.1 “Suppression of Palestinians’&#160;<br/>human development” and 5.5.3 “Discriminatory provision of services”).1307<br/>
Israel has been moving its citizens into the neighbourhood since the 1980s.1308&#160;Several hundred&#160;<br/>settlers live inside enclaves in Wadi Hilweh and Batn Al-Hawa within heavily protected settlement&#160;<br/>compounds.1309&#160;The expansion of settlements in Silwan is led by two settler organizations – Elad and&#160;<br/>Ateret Cohanim – with support, funding and protection from Israeli authorities. Palestinians do not&#160;<br/>receive the same.1310&#160;As outlined above, these two organizations work to displace Palestinian families&#160;<br/>living in East Jerusalem through the Custodian of Absentee Property in order to hand over their homes to&#160;<br/>Jewish settlers, and have initiated scores of eviction claims against Palestinians in the area.&#160;<br/>
The deliberate refusal to approve zoning plans for Silwan has made it virtually impossible for Palestinian&#160;<br/>residents to obtain building permits. Over the years, hundreds of Palestinian homes that were&#160;<br/>consequently built without a permit have been demolished or expropriated.1311&#160;According to OCHA,&#160;<br/>between January 2009 and July 2021, Israeli authorities demolished 164 structures in the Silwan&#160;<br/>neighbourhood, resulting in the forced displacement of least 260 Palestinian residents, including 186&#160;<br/>children.1312&#160;More than 66% of these demolitions happened in the last four years, with 17 demolitions&#160;<br/>taking place in 2020 alone.1313&#160;Today, there are over 2,000 Palestinian residents of Silwan who are at&#160;<br/>imminent risk of forcible transfer as a result of demolition orders.&#160;<br/>
In the neighbourhood of Wadi Yasul, 44 residential structures are threatened with demolition owing to&#160;<br/>the entire area’s designation by the Jerusalem Municipality as a “green zone”,1314&#160;an area designated for&#160;<br/>

has been nearly NIS 100 million (USD 32.3 million). This amount is equivalent to spending NIS 3,000 (USD 968) each month on every&#160;<br/>

1314.&#160;Approximately 22% of East Jerusalem is zoned as “green areas” where Palestinian construction is strictly forbidden. The zoning&#160;of&#160;<br/>
green areas has long been a common practice by Israeli authorities to stop legal Palestinian development and expansion in areas&#160;where the&#160;<br/>
state plans to build or expand Jewish-only settlements. Israeli zoning laws allow municipal&#160;authorities to zone any un-expropriated land as&#160;<br/>
a “green area”. This effectively bars Palestinian development in these areas as Palestinian residents are forbidden from&#160;building on “green&#160;<br/>
areas”. However, these areas are often re-zoned for Jewish settlement construction as well as for the construction of Jewish national or&#160;<br/>
historical parks. See ICAHD,&#160;<i>Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory Briefing to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights:&#160;</i><br/>

<a name=228></a>public and not residential development. As a result, since 1977, Wadi Yasul’s 500 residents have been&#160;<br/>unable to acquire proper building permits leaving their homes at risk of demolition.1315<br/>
For years, residents submitted alternative local outline plans requesting to re-zone Wadi Yasul as a&#160;<br/>residential area. However, Israeli authorities rejected multiple versions of the plans on the grounds that&#160;<br/>they differed from the city’s future plans, which designate the area as a “green zone”.1316&#160;On 3 February&#160;<br/>2020, the community appealed to the Jerusalem District Court over the continuous rejection of their&#160;<br/>plans. A hearing was scheduled on 31 May 2020. However, the residents of Wadi Yasul agreed with the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities to postpone the final court hearing until December&#160;2020 to allow the community to&#160;<br/>meet the Jerusalem District Planning Committee to try and reach an agreement on the plans. The fate&#160;<br/>of the majority of the structures in Wadi Yasul was thus tied to the outcome and decision of the District&#160;<br/>Planning Committee on the proposed plan by the community.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, in June 2010, Elad, with government backing, published plans to expand the area&#160;<br/>designated for tourism into Silwan, to create an area called the King’s Garden.1317&#160;This would mean&#160;<br/>the demolition of 88 Palestinian homes in the Al-Bustan neighbourhood and the forced eviction of&#160;<br/>more than 1,500 people.1318&#160;To justify this, in 2015 the Jerusalem Municipality told the Palestinian&#160;<br/>community that all the houses in Al-Bustan had been built illegally. Yet, like other Palestinian areas in&#160;<br/>East Jerusalem (and Area C of the West Bank), the discriminatory planning regime meant that residents&#160;<br/>of Al-Bustan had had no choice but to build or extend homes without a permit.1319&#160;In the meantime,&#160;<br/>the municipality imposed fines on the homeowners, who were already living in dire poverty.1320&#160;In 2017,&#160;<br/>16 of the homes in Al-Bustan, housing at least 118 individuals, received demolition orders, placing&#160;<br/>them at imminent risk of demolition.1321&#160;Residents of Al-Bustan began to prepare an alternative plan in&#160;<br/>order to retroactively legalize the homes with demolition orders. Israeli authorities had rejected previous&#160;<br/>plans by Al-Bustan residents.1322&#160;A freeze on the demolition of the 16 threatened homes was granted by&#160;<br/>court order from June to October 2020. The community continued to send extension requests as they&#160;<br/>prepared their alternative plan for the area. In late February 2021, the Jerusalem Municipality submitted&#160;<br/>an objection to the community’s requests to freeze the demolition orders and asked the municipal court&#160;<br/>to authorize demolition.1323&#160;On 29 June 2021, Israeli authorities demolished a butcher’s shop owned&#160;<br/>
1315.&#160;Since the 1970s Wadi Yasul has been designated a “green area” placing dozens of Palestinian families living there at risk of&#160;<br/>
imminent demolition. See OCHA, “Wadi Y<a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/wadi-yasul-community-risk-mass-displacement">asul: a Community at Risk of Mass Displacement”, 20 June 2019,&#160;ochaopt.org/content/wadi-</a><br/>

<a name=229></a>by the Al-Rajabi family in Al-Bustan.1324&#160;At least 13 Palestinians were injured as authorities dispersed&#160;<br/>protesters during the demolition.1325<br/>
Mohammed Al-Rajabi, a resident of Al-Bustan whose home was demolished by Israeli authorities on 23&#160;<br/>June 2020, described to Amnesty International the devastating effects of the demolition on his family:&#160;<br/>
<i>I lived in the house for two months before it was demolished. I mean we were dealing with a&#160;<br/>pandemic spreading, and normally these things take time but with us it went down really quick.&#160;<br/>They had court orders to demolish my house within weeks of me starting to construct my house.&#160;<br/>And since my house was in the middle of a crowded area and impossible to demolish with a&#160;<br/>bulldozer they used a machine saw to cut my house in half… anything to make it uninhabitable.</i><br/>
<i>I know that this could have been avoided if I’d got a building permit, but it’s impossible. This could&#160;<br/>not have been avoided; it’s as if it’s been designed this way and there is no exit. My house was&#160;<br/>going to be demolished in all cases, no matter what I do.</i><br/>
<i>The municipality is asking me to pay them for the demolition also. They need NIS 100,000 [USD&#160;<br/>32,258] to cover the expenses of my demolition. They even said that the cost is this high because&#160;<br/>it took more manpower to accomplish than regular demolitions with machinery and bulldozers.</i><br/>
<i>This is extremely hard to deal with. It might be difficult to put into words… and I sensed that it was&#160;<br/>harder on my kids than on us. They were really excited for us to have this new home. I’m going&#160;<br/>to keep the photos from that day and show them to my children when they grow up, so they do&#160;<br/>not forget what happened to us. I will tell them: “You see what kind of memories I have to pass on&#160;<br/>to you?” My plan was for them to have a warm family home close to&#160;their loved ones and family&#160;<br/>members. Now I’m passing on the memories of their first childhood&#160;home being destroyed.1326&#160;&#160;</i><br/>
Israeli authorities also systematically discriminate in the enforcement of building laws against&#160;<br/>Palestinians in Silwan, and fail to enforce the same laws or issue demolition orders against illegally&#160;<br/>constructed structures in Israeli settlements in the area. For example, according to Bimkom, the&#160;<br/>Israeli authorities failed to vacate the seven-storey building known as Beit Yehonatan, which the settler&#160;<br/>group Ateret Cohanim built in 2002 without a permit on an 800m2 plot in Al-Bustan.1327&#160;In 2007, a&#160;<br/>court ordered the building to be sealed and vacated, but to date the municipal authorities have not&#160;<br/>implemented the order.1328<br/>
The expansion of settlement compounds in Silwan, along with an increased presence of Israeli security&#160;<br/>forces and private security guards to protect them, has led to rising tensions among residents,1329&#160;<br/>which contributes to creating a coercive environment. This has led to many reported security incidents&#160;<br/>in Silwan involving children, who are often accused of throwing stones at Israeli settlers and security&#160;<br/>

personnel. Many children have been arrested.1330&#160;For example, a 17-year-old boy told Amnesty&#160;<br/>International in August 2018 that he had been detained three times. “There’s not one kid you see in the&#160;<br/>streets who hasn’t at least been arrested once in this neighbourhood,” he said.1331&#160;<br/>
Arrests often lead to other forms of abuse. Over the years, Amnesty International and other organizations&#160;<br/>have documented how Israeli security forces have used unnecessary force to arrest or detain Palestinian&#160;<br/>children in East Jerusalem and elsewhere in the OPT.1332&#160;&#160;<br/>

In Area C of the West Bank, Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley have been repeatedly targeted&#160;<br/>for demolition. According to B’Tselem, the Israeli Civil Administration demolished at least 698 Palestinian&#160;<br/>residential units in the Jordan Valley between January 2006 and September 2017. The demolished&#160;<br/>structures were home to at least 2,948 Palestinians, at least 1,334 of whom were children. Of these, 783&#160;<br/>Palestinians, including 386 children, had their homes demolished at least twice. From January 2012&#160;<br/>to September 2017, the Civil Administration additionally demolished at least 806 non-residential units,&#160;<br/>including agricultural structures.1333<br/>
1330.&#160;According to the UN there have been more than 560 cases of detention of children in Silwan since 2012. See OCHA, “Humanitarian&#160;<br/>

<a name=231></a><b>AREA C OF WEST BANK &#160;</b><br/>
<b>Khirbet Humsa&#160;</b><br/>
Khirbet Humsa, a Palestinian village of approximately 177 residents, is located in the northern&#160;<br/>Jordan Valley on land leased from the Palestinian city of Tubas in the north of the West Bank.1334&#160;The&#160;<br/>community earn their living as shepherds and farmers. The Israeli settlements of Ro’i, Beka’ot and&#160;<br/>Hemdat surround the village.&#160;<br/>
Since 2007, Amnesty International has been documenting Israeli violations against residents of&#160;<br/>Khirbet Humsa, including multiple demolition incidents and denial of water as means of expulsion.1335&#160;&#160;<br/>Palestinians living in Khirbet Humsa and other similar communities are among the most economically&#160;<br/>marginalized in the OPT. They face harsh winters and summer heat exceeding 400C, and recently the&#160;<br/>Covid-19 pandemic, without access to adequate health facilities. The constant eviction of residents has&#160;<br/>had a devastating economic and social impact, as well as taking a psychological toll on the residents.&#160;<br/>Residents of Khirbet Humsa fear that army bulldozers may return at any time to destroy their homes.<br/>
Israeli authorities prevent Palestinian residents of Khirbet Humsa from connecting to electricity or&#160;<br/>water grids or drilling new wells in the area. The community obtains&#160;its water by travelling and filling&#160;<br/>a water tanker at the Ain Shibli spring, 15km away.1336&#160;Since 1972, the land of Khirbet Humsa has&#160;<br/>been designated as a “firing zone”, which prohibits Palestinian construction and is often used as an&#160;<br/>instrument for mass expulsion of Palestinian Bedouins, especially those living in Area C.1337<br/>
Some 12km north-east of Khirbet Humsa lies the Israeli settlement of Hemdat, which was established&#160;<br/>in 1997 and has a population of 296 Israeli settlers.1338&#160;In 1999, Israeli authorities introduced an&#160;<br/>amendment to the military order regarding Firing Zone 903, which adjusted the borders of the zone&#160;<br/>to allow an enclave outside it for the settlement of Hemdat.1339&#160;The redrawing of the borders privileged&#160;<br/>Jewish Israeli settlers, allowing them to live freely in the firing zone.&#160;<br/>
Analysis of these military zones illustrates that – rather than serving a “military need” – their purpose is&#160;<br/>to drastically reduce the ability of Palestinians to use the land while transferring as much of the land as&#160;<br/>possible to Israeli settlers.1340&#160;The settlement of Hemdat has large homes and, like other settlements,&#160;<br/>is connected to the Israeli water and electricity grids. The settlement&#160;harvests dates and flowers. The&#160;<br/>Jewish settlers have a per capita water usage of 172 litres per day.1341&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=232></a>On 3 November 2020, Israeli forces entered the herder community of Khirbet Humsa and demolished&#160;<br/>or confiscated 29 residential and livelihood structures, displacing 73&#160;people, including 41 children,&#160;<br/>in what was the largest forced displacement incident recorded in recent years.1342&#160;The Israeli Civil&#160;<br/>Administration followed through with the demolitions, stating that the living structures were built illegally&#160;<br/>in a firing zone.1343&#160;The first tent confiscated was the home of Nitham Abu Kbash, a&#160;herder and father of&#160;<br/>three. His residential structure was confiscated a further five times in February 2021. He told Amnesty&#160;<br/>International:<br/>
<i>Having lived my whole life in [Khirbet] Humsa, I have never seen it like this before. The army is&#160;<br/>trying every single way to get rid of us. God knows how we are still here. Never did we have to deal&#160;<br/>with what we went through [in November] last year, where every few days they would come and&#160;<br/>demolish our homes. I know they are trying to use Humsa as an example, because if they succeed&#160;<br/>in displacing us it can be a model for them to use elsewhere. I know the Israelis are choosing to do&#160;<br/>their demolition campaigns during the winter, during the hardest part of the year because we are&#160;<br/>most vulnerable. They know how hard it is to survive during the winters in the Jordan Valley. They&#160;<br/>probably never thought we would remain resilient – that we would stay.1344&#160;</i><br/>
Between November 2020 and July 2021, Israeli authorities demolished&#160;or confiscated at least 210&#160;<br/>residential and livelihood structures, displacing at least 392 residents, including 227 children.1345&#160;<br/>
Five out of six of these demolitions took place during February 2021. Many of these structures were&#160;<br/>donated to the residents of Khirbet Humsa as part of a humanitarian response to the community’s&#160;<br/>vulnerability to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the severe winter conditions in the northern Jordan&#160;<br/>Valley. Many of the residents faced repeated demolitions of their homes and livelihood structures,&#160;<br/>sometimes only days after rebuilding them after a previous demolition or confiscation.&#160;<br/>
During demolitions on 1 February, COGAT informed the community that they must relocate to a site near&#160;<br/>the village of Ain Shibli where their confiscated structures would be&#160;returned.1346&#160; Nitham Abu Kbash&#160;<br/>described the psychological impact of these demolitions on his children:&#160;<br/>
<i>The main virus our community faces is the Israeli army, not Covid-19. My kids are always scared;&#160;<br/>we are all always scared. When the army comes in and your children are terrorized and crying and&#160;<br/>outside in the pouring rain, I promise you, there is no human being on this earth that is meant&#160;<br/>to be able to handle that. The only way to describe it is as a tragedy. And what are we supposed&#160;<br/>to do? We don’t have anywhere to go. Even when the international community, including the EU,&#160;<br/>came to Humsa for solidarity, the army came in and confiscated our&#160;tents in front of diplomats&#160;<br/>and EU representatives. At first we were happy that the EU came; we thought we would be safe,&#160;<br/>that they would be able to stop the demolitions. But we were wrong; no one can protect us.1347&#160;</i><br/>

The evictions in Khirbet Humsa hinder the community’s ability to have an adequate livelihood as their&#160;<br/>livelihood structures for livestock are often demolished or confiscated&#160;as well. Nitham Abu Kbash said:&#160;<br/>
<i>Because of the demolitions I have had some of my sheep die from the conditions outside when&#160;<br/>they confiscated the tent where they live. Other times we didn’t have&#160;water to give them after they&#160;<br/>confiscated our water tanks. What did my sheep do to deserve to die?&#160;My family survives off our&#160;<br/>livestock; it is our only means of living.

We&#160;<br/>are not asking for much.1348&#160;</i><br/>

<b>Jahalin of Khan Al-Ahmar&#160;</b><br/>
The Jahalin Bedouin communities currently residing in the West Bank originate from the Tel Arad area&#160;<br/>in the Negev/Naqab. In the 1950s, Israeli authorities forcibly displaced the Jahalin tribe from their&#160;<br/>original lands. They subsequently moved to the West Bank and continued their traditional pastoral way&#160;<br/>of life and established seasonal migration paths between Jerusalem and Jericho until they settled in&#160;<br/>and around the eastern periphery of Jerusalem on lands leased from Palestinian landowners in the area&#160;<br/>(primarily in Abu Dis, Al-Ezariyeh, Anata, Al-Tur and Al-Issawiyya).1349&#160;In mid-1951, they registered as&#160;<br/>Palestinian refugees with UNRWA and they are currently the largest Bedouin tribe among Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees in the West Bank.1350&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=234></a>There are currently 18 Bedouin communities that belong to the Jahalin tribe who live in and around&#160;<br/>the eastern periphery of Jerusalem,1351&#160;totalling more than 3,000 people, half of whom are children.1352&#160;<br/>These communities belong to the larger group of 46 Bedouin communities in the central West Bank who&#160;<br/>are at “a high risk” of forcible transfer by Israeli authorities, according to the UN.1353<br/>
Since 1967, the Israeli military has restricted vast expanses of the Jahalin’s grazing land by declaring&#160;<br/>them military zones or nature reserves, confiscating land for building&#160;settlements and prohibiting the&#160;<br/>Bedouin from using them. As a result, the Jahalin’s seasonal movement and traditional way of life&#160;<br/>became impossible and they were forced to settle in small encampments in the eastern periphery of&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and south of the West Bank. These areas were subsequently designated as Area C, where the&#160;<br/>Israeli military retains full control of all civilian affairs, including planning and zoning.1354<br/>
In 1975, Israel expropriated 30,000 dunams (3,000 hectares) of the area where the Jahalin lived to&#160;<br/>build the Ma’ale Adumim settlement. This is currently the third most populous Israeli settlement in the&#160;<br/>West Bank with nearly 40,000 settlers.1355&#160;In the following years, Israel expropriated yet more land,&#160;<br/>began constructing Ma’ale Adumim, and established the Mishor Adumim industrial zone and the&#160;<br/>settlements of Kfar Adumim, now with a population of over 4,300 Israeli settlers,1356&#160;and Kedar, with&#160;<br/>around 1,500 settlers.1357&#160;<br/>
In the 1990s, the area became particularly significant due to Israel’s&#160;plan to annex the settlements and&#160;<br/>connect them to Jerusalem, known as the E1 (an abbreviation of East 1) plan. The E1 plan envisages&#160;<br/>the expansion of around 4,000 housing units, hotels, an industrial area and a large Israeli border&#160;<br/>police station to serve as the border police headquarters for the West Bank area. The police station was&#160;<br/>officially opened in 2008 and much of the infrastructure is already in&#160;place. The E1 plan has not been&#160;<br/>fully implemented by successive Israeli governments due to international opposition, mainly from the&#160;<br/>EU and the US government. If implemented, the plan will effectively cut the geographic contiguity of the&#160;<br/>West Bank, with a solid line of Israeli settlements dividing the northern and southern parts of the West&#160;<br/>Bank. The E1 plan will also prevent development of the Palestinian neighbourhoods of Al-Tur and Al-<br/>Issawiyya in East Jerusalem.&#160;<br/>
In 2004, the construction of the fence/wall in the area began, cutting off the Jahalin Bedouins from&#160;<br/>Jerusalem. Along with the expansion of settlements, the fence/wall enclaved the Jahalin in the area and&#160;<br/>placed them under further threat of forced displacement. When the Israeli government announced its&#160;<br/>annexation plans in May 2020, it stated that it was highly likely to annex the Ma’ale Adumim settlements’&#160;<br/>bloc to Israel.1358<br/>
As a result of the establishment and expansion of settlements, the Jahalin Bedouins in the area were&#160;<br/>forcibly displaced and their homes demolished by Israeli authorities in 1994, 1997 and 1998.1359&#160;Since&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
234<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=235></a>2011, Israeli authorities have proposed plans to forcibly transfer all the communities in the area. These&#160;<br/>plans, along with home demolitions and forced evictions, have worsened social and legal conditions&#160;<br/>and&#160;increased pressure on the Jahalin to leave. The plans had not been implemented as of end of&#160;<br/>August 2021.&#160;<br/>
Because they lack access to grazing lands in the area, many of the Bedouin communities have&#160;<br/>abandoned their traditional way of life and currently depend on humanitarian assistance. More than half&#160;<br/>of the communities are food insecure; none of the communities has access to the electricity grid; and&#160;<br/>only half are connected to water networks.1360<br/>
The village of Khan Al-Ahmar is home to approximately 180 Bedouins from the Jahalin tribe, more than&#160;<br/>half of whom are children.1361&#160;The village has more than 160 structures, including a school, a mosque,&#160;<br/>kitchens, animal shelters and a clinic, mostly made of corrugated metal, wood and makeshift materials&#160;<br/>such as tyres. The Israeli settlement of Kfar Adumim is just 2km from the village.&#160;<br/>
For years, Israel has been trying to forcibly transfer the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, to expand&#160;<br/>settlements in the region and has issued demolition orders against every structure in the village built&#160;<br/>without permits. Amnesty International has documented the demolitions of at least 25 homes in Khan&#160;<br/>Al-Ahmar over the lack of building permits between 2008 and 2018.1362&#160;&#160;<br/>
On 24 May 2018, following a nine-year legal battle against the demolition orders, the Supreme Court&#160;<br/>of Israel ruled in favour of razing the entire community and relocating Palestinian residents elsewhere,&#160;<br/>finding “no reason to intervene in the decision of the minister of defence to implement the demolition&#160;<br/>orders issued against the illegal structures in Khan Al-Ahmar.”1363&#160;A few days later, the Israeli Civil&#160;<br/>Administration approved the construction of 92 new homes for Kfar Adumim.1364&#160;Abu Khames, the&#160;<br/>spokesperson and a resident of the community, told Amnesty International in June 2018:&#160;<br/>
<i>If this was an Israeli village, the court ruling would have been completely different… If a settler&#160;<br/>house was built nearby, the Israeli Civil Administration would open an entire road for that house,&#160;<br/>and provide it with electricity and water, but for us, we have been struggling for years to have such&#160;<br/>essential services provided to us, and instead we get nothing other than a Supreme Court ruling&#160;<br/>that would displace us from our land.1365&#160;</i><br/>
On 4 July 2018, the Israeli army attempted to forcibly evict the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, violently&#160;<br/>attacking them and solidarity activists. This triggered further legal action by the community in the hope&#160;<br/>of protecting their village by petitioning the Supreme Court. On 5 September 2018, the court upheld its&#160;<br/>decision and rejected the community’s petition. The decision to demolish an entire community in the&#160;<br/>OPT generated wide international condemnation including by the Prosecutor of the ICC. Seemingly as a&#160;<br/>result of this pressure, the authorities refrained from carrying out the demolitions.&#160;<br/>
This is in turn led to a petition to the Supreme Court by Israeli settler organization Regavim, which&#160;<br/>pushed for the demolition orders to be implemented.<br/>

On 29 November 2020, the Supreme Court ruled on this petition, stating that, if the residents of Khan&#160;<br/>Al-Ahmar did not reach a settlement with the Israeli military and civil administrations, the demolition&#160;<br/>orders would be implemented on 15 July 2021.1366&#160;Following the ruling, the Israeli authorities asked the&#160;<br/>court for more time to prepare plans for the implementation of the demolition order citing Covid-19 and&#160;<br/>considerations relating to the “diplomatic-security situation”. This prompted a second petition to the&#160;<br/>Supreme Court by Regavim. When the court scheduled a hearing on this for 6 March 2022, it criticized&#160;<br/>the state for “inaction and feet dragging” over the demolitions.1367<br/>

He holds a Jerusalem residency permit and works as a&#160;field researcher for Addameer, a legal&#160;<br/>aid and prisoners’ rights NGO, which was declared – together with five other civil society groups – as a&#160;<br/>“terrorist organization” in October 2021. UN human rights experts condemned this move as a misuse&#160;<br/>of counterterrorism measures and a “frontal attack on the Palestinian human rights movement, and on&#160;<br/>human rights everywhere”.1373&#160;The Israeli authorities have persistently harassed him and violated his rights&#160;<br/>to freedom of movement and family, his residency rights, and his right to live in his city of birth. He is at&#160;<br/>risk of forcible deportation as the Israeli authorities have taken action to revoke his residency status.1374&#160;&#160;<br/>
Since the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;in 2000, Israeli authorities have detained Salah Hammouri several times,&#160;<br/>including twice when he was placed under administrative detention –&#160;for five months in 2004 and for 13&#160;<br/>months in 2017.1375<br/>
In 2005, he was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of planning an attack on&#160;<br/>the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, Ovadia Yosef. Shortly before his release, the then French&#160;<br/>minister of foreign affairs expressed regret at the fact that the Israeli authorities refused to shorten Salah&#160;<br/>Hammouri’s sentence given the lack of strong evidence against him.1376&#160;He was eventually released in&#160;<br/>December 2011, three months before the end of his sentence under a prisoner exchange deal. After his&#160;<br/>arrest, Salah Hammouri was offered a deal (negotiated by the French consulate) of being deported to&#160;<br/>France for 10 years instead of being imprisoned, but he refused in fear of prolonged exile.<br/>
In September 2014, Israel imposed a six-month travel ban on Salah Hammouri preventing him from&#160;<br/>entering the West Bank and hindering his progress towards achieving a degree in law from Al-Quds&#160;<br/>University near Abu Dis in the West Bank. The ban was renewed twice for a total of 18 months. He was&#160;<br/>only able to go back to university after the ban was lifted.1377&#160;During the 18 months, he was also unable&#160;<br/>to go to his workplace at Addameer in Ramallah in the West Bank.&#160;<br/>
On 3 September 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Interior notified Salah Hammouri of its intention to revoke&#160;<br/>his permanent residency status on the grounds of “breach of allegiance” to the State of Israel.1378&#160;He&#160;<br/>

was given 30 days to challenge this decision by submitting a written response to the Israeli interior&#160;<br/>minister, which would later be examined ahead of a final decision. Salah&#160;Hammouri said:&#160;<br/>
<i>The “breach of allegiance to the State of Israel” will affect my work. We [Addameer] are already&#160;<br/>under constant inspection by the Israeli authorities for the work we do&#160;in the field of human rights,&#160;<br/>but with this accusation of theirs, we’ll be even put under further surveillance of every activity we&#160;<br/>do: every visit I make to meet Palestinian prisoners, every conference&#160;I attend, and briefing I join…&#160;<br/>The scope of their accusations is so broad it could literally include anything and hinder my work –&#160;<br/>and anyone who does such work – in defending prisoners and Palestinians’ rights… If you ask me&#160;<br/>what’s my worst fear in all of this, it’s having to leave my country by force with no hope of being&#160;<br/>able to come back. In a nutshell, I do not want to leave, and I refuse to be forced to do so.</i><br/>
On 29 June 2021, Israeli interior minister Ayelet Shaked announced the adoption of recommendations&#160;<br/>to revoke the permanent residency of Salah Hammouri based on “breach of allegiance”, confirming her&#160;<br/>intentions to proceed with approving the process. Israeli attorney general Avichai Mendelblit and minister&#160;<br/>of justice Gideon Sa’ar must still approve the revocation.1379<br/>
Israeli authorities have also banned his wife, Elsa Lefort, a French national, from entering Israel and&#160;<br/>the OPT since 5 January 2016, citing security concerns and forcing the family to live apart. They can&#160;<br/>only see each other when Salah Hammouri visits her in France every few months.1380&#160;The couple’s&#160;<br/>family reunification requests to the Israeli Ministry of Interior to allow&#160;the family to live together in the&#160;<br/>OPT have all been rejected on security grounds because Salah Hammouri was released through a&#160;<br/>prisoner exchange deal. The most recent application for family unification was on 20 April 2021. Salah&#160;<br/>Hammouri told Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>As to how all of this affects me personally, I will not say this is something we get used to, but it became&#160;<br/>rather another daily life obstacle I have to deal with – being separated from my family, this ongoing&#160;<br/>and never-ending uncertainty and feeling uneasy all the time. This has affected my relationship with&#160;<br/>my son, between me being here and him in France with his mother, only meeting every few months&#160;<br/>and over video calls. And my wife is currently pregnant, and we are awaiting a newborn, and as&#160;<br/>much as we’re excited we are also worried. Imagine my wife gives birth in France and I’m there with&#160;<br/>her, then they do not allow me back in the country. I have family here, friends, my work, and life.</i><br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=239></a>In the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, Israel has engaged in another systematic&#160;<br/>and widespread policy since 1967 – the forcible transfer of Palestinian detainees, including children, to&#160;<br/>prisons inside Israel.1381&#160;It has also transferred prisoners from the rest of the OPT to the Gaza Strip, either as&#160;<br/>a condition of release or as a punitive measure, which also amounts to forcible transfer.1382&#160;<br/>
As outlined above (see section 5.3.4 “Use of military rule”), since 1967, Israeli security forces have arrested&#160;<br/>over 800,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, according to an&#160;<br/>estimate by Addameer.1383&#160;All but one of the 17 prisons where Palestinians from the OPT are detained are&#160;<br/>located inside of Israel in breach of Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that protected&#160;<br/>persons accused of offences should be detained in the occupied territory. This long-standing policy is not&#160;<br/>only unlawful but also cruel and has devastating consequences for the rights of detainees to family visits in&#160;<br/>addition to undermining their right to education. Even though the Israeli Prison Service Regulations grant all&#160;<br/>prisoners family visits once every two weeks, Palestinians from the OPT visit much less frequently as they are&#160;<br/>required to apply for permits to enter Israel, which are often denied on&#160;unspecified “security” grounds.1384&#160;<br/>
<b>6.1.3 PATTERN OF INHUMAN OR INHUMANE ACTS&#160;<br/></b>Across Israel and the OPT, Israeli authorities have employed a set of interrelated discriminatory policies and&#160;<br/>practices that have directly caused the displacement and dispossession of Palestinian communities, created&#160;<br/>unbearable living&#160;conditions for Palestinians&#160;that have coerced their displacement, or put them at high risk of&#160;<br/>forced displacement, amounting to a state-sanctioned policy of forcible transfer of population. These policies&#160;<br/>have been carried out in a widespread and systematic manner, combined with violent acts. This has been&#160;<br/>widely documented by Amnesty International and other local and international human rights organizations,&#160;<br/>as well as by the UN, over the decades.<br/>
The process of forcible transfer is the result of organized governmental policy, as indicated by laws, formal&#160;<br/>planning documents and statements by senior officials that have stated in some instances that such policies&#160;<br/>are pursued to change the demographic nature of these localities to ensure a Jewish majority. Israel also&#160;<br/>continues to deny Palestinian refugees displaced in 1948 and 1967 the right to return to their homes and&#160;<br/>property or the right to residency or citizenship in Israel or the OPT.<br/>
The restrictions on Palestinians amount to a violation, on discriminatory grounds, of the right to freedom of&#160;<br/>movement. In addition to the severity of the deprivation of freedom of movement, these restrictions have&#160;<br/>led to the deprivation of a raft of other rights similarly enshrined in international law,1385&#160;underlining the wide&#160;<br/>reach of this crime against Palestinians in Israel and the OPT.<br/>
Israel’s discriminatory state policies, regulations and conduct against Palestinians have involved the crime&#160;<br/>against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer in violation of fundamental rules of international law&#160;<br/>as provided in the Rome Statute, as well as denying to members of a racial group the right to freedom&#160;<br/>of movement as prohibited in the Apartheid Convention. Within the OPT, policies of unlawful deportation&#160;<br/>or transfer, which are carried out neither for military necessity nor the protection of the population of the&#160;<br/>occupied territory, also constitute war crimes under the Rome Statute.<br/>

<a name=240></a><b>6.2 ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION AND TORTURE&#160;<br/>6.2.1 RELEVANT CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW<br/></b>Article 7(1)(e) of the Rome Statute criminalizes “[i]mprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical&#160;<br/>liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law” as a crime against humanity. Similarly, the&#160;<br/>Apartheid Convention criminalizes both the “arbitrary arrest and illegal imprisonment of the members of a&#160;<br/>racial group”.1386<br/>
The prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolute&#160;<br/>and non-derogable, even during a declared state of emergency or armed conflict.1387&#160;Both the Apartheid&#160;<br/>Convention and the Rome Statute reflect this absolute prohibition of&#160;torture and other ill-treatment, and&#160;<br/>establish that “torture” amounts to the crime against humanity of apartheid when “committed in the context&#160;<br/>of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other&#160;<br/>racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”. Article II(a)(ii) of the&#160;<br/>Apartheid Convention criminalizes:<br/>
<i>… the infliction upon the members of a racial group or groups of serious bodily or mental harm, by&#160;<br/>the infringement of their freedom or dignity, or by subjecting them to torture or to cruel, inhuman or&#160;<br/>degrading treatment or punishment.</i><br/>
Under Article (7)(1)(f) of the Rome Stature, torture is defined as a crime against humanity. Torture and other&#160;<br/>ill-treatment committed in occupied territory violates international humanitarian law and, under Article (8)(2)<br/>(a)(ii) of the Rome Statute, is defined as a war crime.&#160;<br/>
<b>6.2.2 ISRAELI POLICIES AND PRACTICES<br/>ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION<br/></b>Since the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, the Israeli authorities have made widespread&#160;<br/>use of administrative detention to imprison thousands of Palestinians, including children, without charge or&#160;<br/>trial under renewable detention orders.&#160;<br/>
There are no exact figures on the number of administrative detention&#160;orders issued against Palestinians&#160;<br/>since 1967 because the Israeli authorities have not consistently made them available to NGOs or the wider&#160;<br/>public.1388&#160;Monitoring by Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations shows that its use has fluctuated&#160;<br/>over the years, rising at times of heightened tensions in the OPT. Israel held more than 5,000 Palestinians,&#160;<br/>some repeatedly, in administrative detention between the beginning&#160;of the first&#160;<i>intifada</i>&#160;in December 1987&#160;<br/>and June 1989.1389&#160;Approximately two months after the outbreak of the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>, on 13 December&#160;<br/>2000, there were only 12 administrative detainees. The number rose drastically following a major military&#160;<br/>offensive in the West Bank codenamed “Operation Defensive Shield”, reaching 960 administrative detainees&#160;<br/>in December 2002 and 1,119 in April 2003. Numbers remained high (between approximately 600 and 850&#160;<br/>at any given time) until the end of 2009 when they dropped below 300 before rising again in 2014.1390&#160;At the&#160;<br/>end of May 2020, 352 Palestinians, including two children, all from the occupied West Bank, were held as&#160;<br/>administrative detainees, according to information provided by the Israel Prison Service to B’Tselem.1391<br/>

<a name=241></a>Data made available to B’Tselem also shows that, while the vast majority of administrative detainees held&#160;<br/>between January 2011 and July 2020 received orders lasting up to a year, many others were held for up to&#160;<br/>two years and a minority for over that time. For example, out of 548 Palestinians administratively detained&#160;<br/>on 21 January 2009, 330 had been held for up to a year, 176 for periods ranging between one and two&#160;<br/>years, and 39 for periods ranging between two and three and a half years. One detainee had been in&#160;<br/>administrative detention for a period between four and four and a half years, and two others for more than&#160;<br/>four and a half years.1392<br/>
Administrative detention is a form of detention under which individuals are detained by state authorities&#160;<br/>without intent to prosecute them in a criminal trial and is based on secret security grounds that the&#160;<br/>defendant and their lawyer cannot review. Administrative detention is used to circumvent the legal&#160;<br/>protection and due process guaranteed for all persons deprived of their liberty under international law.&#160;<br/>While not completely prohibited under international law, the use of administrative detention is only&#160;<br/>permitted in exceptional circumstances, subject to stringent safeguards.1393&#160;However, Israel’s systematic&#160;<br/>use of administrative detention against Palestinians indicates that it is used to persecute Palestinians&#160;<br/>rather than as an extraordinary and selectively used preventative measure. This is evident given that Israel&#160;<br/>labels Palestinians as “security detainees”, and practice and evidence have shown that this is a pretext to&#160;<br/>persecute and deprive people of their fundamental rights and freedoms because they challenge Israel’s&#160;<br/>occupation and its policies.&#160;<br/>
Under Military Order 1651,1394&#160;Israeli military commanders have autonomous discretion to issue individual&#160;<br/>temporary administrative detention orders of up to six months to detain Palestinians if there are “reasonable&#160;<br/>grounds” to presume that an individual presents a risk to “the security of the area” or to “public security”.1395&#160;<br/>The military commander can extend administrative detention orders&#160;indefinitely. Under Military Order 1651,&#160;<br/>a Palestinian administrative detainee must be brought before a military judge within eight days of issue or&#160;<br/>renewal of the detention order, or released.1396&#160;Although administrative detainees have the right to appeal&#160;<br/>every detention order and are entitled to legal counsel of their choice, neither the lawyer nor the detainee&#160;<br/>is informed of the details of the evidence against them. A military judge has the power to uphold, shorten&#160;<br/>or cancel the order. If the order is upheld, Palestinian detainees can contest the military judges’ rulings by&#160;<br/>petitioning the Supreme Court of Israel.&#160;<br/>
The Supreme Court has issued rulings emphasizing the importance of judicial review,1397&#160;and stating that&#160;<br/>administrative detention may only be used as a preventative measure against an individual posing a danger&#160;<br/>to security that no other means will prevent.1398&#160;However, it has not set clear substantive standards for&#160;<br/>reviewing administrative detention, has rarely examined whether military judges’ decisions conform to its&#160;<br/>own rulings, and has been reluctant to intervene in specific cases or&#160;question the privileged intelligence&#160;<br/>information on which detention orders are based.1399<br/>

1393.&#160;In the context of an occupation, the Fourth Geneva Convention specifies that a civilian may&#160;only be interned or placed in assigned&#160;<br/>
residence if “the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary” (Article 42) or, in occupied territory, for “imperative reasons&#160;<br/>
of security” (Article 78).&#160;<br/>
1394.&#160;Military Order 1651 went into effect on 2 May 2010, replacing and consolidating a number of Israeli military orders effective since&#160;<br/>

1395.&#160;Local commanders can issue administrative detention orders. These terms are not defined&#160;in the military order, and their&#160;<br/>
interpretation is left to the discretion of military commanders. See Military Order 1651, Chapter I, Article B.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=242></a>Since 2005, Israel has used the Internment of Unlawful Combatants Law of 2002 to place Palestinians from&#160;<br/>the Gaza Strip under administrative detention.1400&#160;Although judicial review takes place before a civil court,&#160;<br/>rather than a military court, the procedural safeguards under the law are weaker than those of Military Order&#160;<br/>1651. The detainee must be brought before a district court judge within 14 days of the date of the detention&#160;<br/>order. The judge can only cancel the order if they find that the (very&#160;malleable) conditions for it are not&#160;<br/>satisfied. As the order is of indefinite duration, there is no provision for the judge to shorten it. Once an order&#160;<br/>is approved, the detainee is brought before a district court judge every six months; the judge can only annul&#160;<br/>the order if they find that release of the detainee will not harm state&#160;security (contrary to the presumption&#160;<br/>under the law), or that there are special (unspecified) grounds for release. Decisions of the district court may&#160;<br/>be appealed to the Supreme Court, but such cases are heard by a single Supreme Court judge who reviews&#160;<br/>the case according to the same stipulations as the District Court. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled that the&#160;<br/>law was unconstitutional.1401<br/>
According to B’Tselem and HaMoked, Israel held 39 Palestinians from the Gaza Strip under this law in 2009,&#160;<br/>releasing most of them later that year.1402&#160;There is no clear information on how many Palestinians from Gaza&#160;<br/>have been held under the law since then, but B’Tselem found that a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip was&#160;<br/>held in administrative detention under the Internment of Unlawful Combatants Law from August 2014 to&#160;<br/>April 2018.1403<br/>
Israel justifies the use of administrative detention as a necessary preventative measure used “as the&#160;<br/>exception”,1404&#160;when evidence against an individual “engaged in illegal acts that endanger the security&#160;<br/>of the area and the lives of civilians” cannot be presented in ordinary criminal proceedings “for reasons&#160;<br/>of confidentiality and protection of intelligence sources”.1405&#160;However, evidence collected by Amnesty&#160;<br/>International and other human rights groups over the decades indicates an intentional Israeli policy to detain&#160;<br/>individuals, including prisoners of conscience, solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of&#160;<br/>expression and association,1406&#160;and punish them for their views challenging the policies of the occupation.1407<br/>
1400.&#160;According to an Israeli Supreme Court ruling from 2008, detention under the Internment of Unlawful Combatants Law is a form&#160;<br/>
of administrative detention, and therefore restrictions that apply to the use of administrative detention under Military Order&#160;1651 or the&#160;<br/>
Emergency Powers (Detention) Law also apply to internment under this law. The court held that the status of “unlawful combatant” does not&#160;<br/>
exist in international humanitarian law, that such persons are civilians entitled to the protections of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and that&#160;<br/>
the state must prove that the individual poses a danger or a threat. Nevertheless, the justices did not discuss the presumptions specified in&#160;<br/>
the law. In effect, the law enables the state to hold detainees indefinitely under presumptions of guilt that render the judicial review almost&#160;<br/>
meaningless. See Amnesty International,&#160;<i>Starved of Justice: Palestinians Detained without Trial by Israel</i>&#160;(Index: MDE 15/026/2012), 6 June&#160;<br/>

1404.&#160;Israeli authorities maintain that the use of administrative detention in the OPT is consistent with Article 78 of the Fourth&#160;Geneva&#160;<br/>
Convention, which states: “If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures&#160;<br/>
concerning protected persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment.” According to the commentary of&#160;<br/>
Jean Pictet, a leading authority on the Geneva Convention, “such measures can only be ordered for real and imperative reasons&#160;of security;&#160;<br/>
their exceptional character must be preserved.” Furthermore, “in occupied territories the internment of protected persons should be even&#160;<br/>
more exceptional than it is inside the territory of the Parties to the conflict”, and detainees can only be interned within the occupied territory,&#160;<br/>
not inside the occupying state. Israel’s practice of administrative detention over many years clearly violates these provisions. See ICRC,&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=243></a>Israel’s intention to crack down on dissent to the occupation is also evident by its policy to release&#160;<br/>administrative detainees if they agree to leave the OPT and go into exile abroad for a specified time, in&#160;<br/>contravention of international law that prohibits the forcible transfer or deportation of the population of an&#160;<br/>occupied territory. The policy also undermines Israel’s justification of the use of administrative detention as a&#160;<br/>necessary preventative measure against Palestinians.1408<br/>
Within the OPT, administrative detention mechanisms are discriminatory against the Palestinian population,&#160;<br/>evident by the differential access to two bodies of Israeli laws and courts, one for Palestinians and another&#160;<br/>for Israeli settlers.&#160;<br/>
For Israeli settlers in the West Bank, administrative detention orders are issued under civil Israeli law and&#160;<br/>administrative detainees are brought before civilian courts. Israel relies on the provisions of the Emergency&#160;<br/>Powers (Detention) Law of 1979 to hold Israeli settlers residing in the occupied territory under administrative&#160;<br/>detention orders.1409&#160;The law is also used to detain Israeli citizens and Palestinian residents of occupied East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem. Under the law, the Israeli minister of defence must have “reasonable grounds to presume that&#160;<br/>the security of the state or public security require the detention”.1410&#160;Similarly to the military order applicable&#160;<br/>to Palestinians in the West Bank, the administrative order can be issued for up to six months and renewed&#160;<br/>indefinitely. As for the judicial review of the administrative detention&#160;order, orders against Israeli settlers&#160;<br/>(and other Israeli citizens) must be reviewed within 48 hours by an Israeli civilian judge at a district court.&#160;<br/>The court is also required to automatically review the order no later than three months after the first judicial&#160;<br/>review. The detainee can appeal the decision of the district court to the Supreme Court. Proceedings at both&#160;<br/>the district court and Supreme Court are held behind closed doors and evidence justifying the order can be&#160;<br/>withheld from the detainee and their lawyer.<br/>
In contrast to the widespread use of administrative detention orders against Palestinians, such orders have&#160;<br/>rarely been used against Jewish Israeli settlers. According to B’Tselem, Israel has used administrative&#160;<br/>detention orders against Israeli citizens, including settlers, but they remain isolated cases.1411<br/>
In one emblematic case of the devastating consequences of Israel’s abusive use of administrative detention&#160;<br/>to punish Palestinians for their legitimate non-violent political activities and their dissenting views, Ahmad&#160;<br/>Qatamesh, an academic from Ramallah, has spent a total of more than 10 years in Israeli prisons without&#160;<br/>charge or trial between 1992 and 2017. The repeated renewals of his administrative detention orders&#160;<br/>have not only had a detrimental effect on his mental health but also on his family. Amnesty International&#160;<br/>campaigned for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience.&#160;<br/>
<b>AHMAD QATAMESH</b><br/>
Ahmad Qatamesh is a writer and university professor from Ramallah in the West Bank. Israeli authorities&#160;<br/>have arbitrarily arrested and detained him for his peaceful expression of his political views, including&#160;<br/>in his writing and teaching. He has spent over 10 years in administrative detention and four years in&#160;<br/>prison on charges of membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a left-<br/>wing political party with an armed wing, banned by Israel.1412&#160;Israel has consistently violated his rights&#160;<br/>to freedom of expression and association and his right to work and earn a livelihood, with a devastating&#160;<br/>

<a name=244></a>impact on his life and health. Ahmed Qatamesh is also an outspoken critic of Palestinian authorities in&#160;<br/>the West Bank and Gaza.&#160;<br/>
His first arrest was in the 1970s, when he spent four years in prison&#160;on charges related to involvement&#160;<br/>in the PFLP. In 1992, Israeli authorities accused him of continued membership in the PFLP, which he&#160;<br/>denied, and held him as an administrative detainee for six years without charge or trial.1413&#160;&#160;<br/>
Between April 2011 and December 2013,1414&#160;Israeli forces held Ahmed Qatamesh in administrative&#160;<br/>detention over allegations that he was a member of the political bureau of the PFLP.1415&#160;He was arrested&#160;<br/>once again on 15 May 2017 and placed in administrative detention for three months.1416&#160;<br/>
Israeli forces arrested him most recently on 24 December 2019 during a sweep of arrests of Palestinians&#160;<br/>associated or perceived to be associated with the PFLP in the aftermath of the killing of a 17-year-<br/>old Israeli girl, Rina Shnerb, near the West Bank settlement of Dolev on 23 August 2019.1417&#160;On 30&#160;<br/>December 2019, he was charged according to military law with “giving services” and “providing&#160;<br/>a lecture” to an “illegal organization”. On 2 January 2020 a military court approved his release on&#160;<br/>condition that he made a bail payment of NIS 7,000 (USD 2,258) and attended all court hearings.&#160;<br/>However, on the same day he was handed an administrative detention order and kept in detention until&#160;<br/>his release on 30 July 2020. Ten days before his release, the military court sentenced him to a four-<br/>month suspended prison sentence valid for three years.&#160;<br/>
Ahmad Qatamesh’s repeated arrests, periods of imprisonment and uncertainty about lengths of&#160;<br/>detention (due to the nature of administrative detention) have taken a toll on him and his family. He told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>When I was arrested back in 1992 my daughter Haneen was only three years old, but she had to&#160;<br/>suffer with me all the while to see her father in prison twice every month. She began to understand&#160;<br/>the meaning of imprisonment at a very young age, yet she never really stopped raising big&#160;<br/>questions, asking again and again, “How long will it go on for?” As the end of each renewal to the&#160;<br/>administrative detention order approached, hopes of being reunited with family would be raised.&#160;<br/>But all it took to destroy this hope and postpone happiness, time after time, was for the Israeli&#160;<br/>Military Commander to issue a new administrative detention order...&#160;</i><br/>
<i>When you are in administrative detention, you know the date of your detention, but not the date of&#160;<br/>your release, which is in the hands of whoever gave the detention order.

<i>The experience of being in administrative detention was not only mentally exhausting for Ahmad,&#160;<br/>but also for us.

Palestinian administrative detainees – as well as other Palestinian prisoners held by Israel – are routinely&#160;<br/>subjected to torture and other ill-treatment; poor prison conditions, including inadequate medical care;&#160;<br/>detention in prisons inside Israel rather than in the OPT; and prohibitions on family visits.<br/>
Many Palestinian administrative detainees have reported they were routinely tortured and otherwise ill-<br/>treated during arrest and interrogation, especially by the Israel Security Agency.1418&#160;The use of administrative&#160;<br/>detention may result in arbitrary detention and, if prolonged or repeated, can amount to cruel, inhuman and&#160;<br/>degrading treatment or punishment.1419&#160;The UN Committee against Torture has also repeatedly concluded&#160;<br/>that the use by Israel of administrative detention, particularly for “inordinately lengthy periods”, violates the&#160;<br/>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention&#160;<br/>against Torture), and called upon Israel to urgently end this practice.1420&#160;<br/>
<b>TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT<br/></b>Torture and other ill-treatment during arrest and interrogation of Palestinians in Israel and the OPT is&#160;<br/>widespread. For decades, Palestinian detainees, including children, have reported torture or other ill-<br/>treatment by the Israel Security Agency, the Israel Prison Service and Israeli military forces during arrest,&#160;<br/>transfer and interrogation. Prompt, thorough and impartial investigations by Israeli authorities into such&#160;<br/>allegations are extremely rare.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=246></a>Widespread patterns of torture and other ill-treatment by Israeli security forces against Palestinians have&#160;<br/>been documented for decades, particularly in the OPT. Amnesty International’s reporting on torture by&#160;<br/>Israel began in the 1970s.1421&#160;In the 1980s and 1990s, it and other human rights organizations recorded&#160;<br/>widespread&#160;torture&#160;during&#160;and&#160;after&#160;the&#160;first&#160;<i>intifada</i>.1422&#160;In 1997, CAT made the following damning conclusion:<br/>
<i>… the methods of interrogation, which were described by non&#160;governmental organizations on the basis&#160;<br/>of accounts given to them by interrogatees and appear to be applied systematically, were neither&#160;<br/>confirmed nor denied by Israel. The Committee, therefore, must assume them to be accurate. These&#160;<br/>methods include: (1) restraining in very painful conditions, (2) hooding under special conditions, (3)&#160;<br/>sounding of loud music for prolonged periods, (4) sleep deprivation for prolonged periods, (5) threats,&#160;<br/>including death threats, (6) violent shaking, and (7) using cold air to chill; and are in the Committee's&#160;<br/>view breaches of article 16 and also constitute torture as defined in article 1 of the Convention. This&#160;<br/>conclusion is particularly evident where such methods of interrogation are used in combination, which&#160;<br/>appears to be the standard case.1423&#160;</i><br/>
In 1999 the Israeli Supreme Court delivered a landmark ruling that both revealed and outlawed various&#160;<br/>methods of torture systematically employed by the Israel Security Agency and other Israeli security forces,&#160;<br/>overwhelmingly against Palestinian detainees and prisoners.1424&#160;In 2000, a report by the Israeli State&#160;<br/>Comptroller concluded that, during the first&#160;<i>intifada</i>, between 1988 and 1992, the Israel Security Agency&#160;<br/>“used systematic torture against Palestinians and regularly lied about it”.1425&#160;<br/>
Despite these official conclusions and ruling, human rights organizations have continued to report&#160;<br/>widespread torture and other ill-treatment from the 2000s to the present day. The Public Committee Against&#160;<br/>Torture in Israel publishes yearly situation reports.1426&#160;Other Israeli organizations have documented violations&#160;<br/>in general and in particular interrogation facilities.1427&#160;Palestinian organizations have done similarly, covering&#160;<br/>Israeli practices in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.1428&#160;&#160;<br/>
Particularly harsh are methods used by the Israel Security Agency to obtain information and “confessions”,&#160;<br/>practices well documented by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.1429&#160;Methods&#160;<br/>

<a name=247></a>reported by Palestinian detainees include painful shackling and binding; immobilization in stress positions;&#160;<br/>sleep deprivation; the use of threats, including against family members; sexual harassment; the extensive&#160;<br/>use of prolonged solitary confinement; and verbal abuse. All these methods amount to torture or other&#160;<br/>ill-treatment. Interrogations under torture can last for weeks, with the detainee routinely denied access to a&#160;<br/>lawyer.1430&#160;Torture and other ill-treatment are frequently inflicted with the complicity of medical professionals,&#160;<br/>especially on detainees staging prolonged hunger strikes.1431&#160;&#160;<br/>
Palestinian children are among those subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including to obtain&#160;<br/>“confessions”, and are denied access to counsel or family visits.1432&#160;At the end of June 2020, according&#160;<br/>to B’Tselem, at least 151 children were held in Israeli prisons, at least two of them in administrative&#160;<br/>detention.1433&#160;According to UNICEF, the UN Children’s Fund, ill-treatment of Palestinian children in the&#160;<br/>Israeli military detention system is “widespread, systematic, and institutionalized throughout the process,&#160;<br/>from the moment of arrest until the child’s prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing”.1434&#160;Human&#160;<br/>rights organizations have come to similar conclusions. Defense for Children International – Palestine&#160;<br/>concluded in 2016: “Out of 429 West Bank children detained between 2012 and 2015, three-quarters&#160;<br/>endured some form of physical violence following arrest.”1435&#160;It has reported regularly on the torture and&#160;<br/>other ill-treatment of Palestinian children, including solitary confinement, blindfolding and violent methods&#160;<br/>of restraint.1436&#160;Save the Children has also documented physical abuse of children in military detention&#160;<br/>across the West Bank.1437&#160;B’Tselem and HaMoked reported in 2017 on the abuse of hundreds of Palestinian&#160;<br/>teenagers arrested every year in East Jerusalem:<br/>
<i>… it is a case of a plain and clear policy followed by the various authorities: the police who carry out&#160;<br/>the arrests; the IPS (Israel Prison Service) which keeps the1438&#160;boys incarcerated in harsh conditions;&#160;<br/>and finally, the courts, where judges virtually automatically extend the boys’ custodial remand, even in&#160;<br/>cases when the arrest was unwarranted to begin with, even when the interrogation is already over, and&#160;<br/>even in cases of boys complaining of being subjected to physical abuse.</i><br/>
Even though it is contrary to international law, the Israel Security Agency justifies interrogations where&#160;<br/>detainees are tortured or otherwise ill-treated as “necessity interrogations”.1439&#160;The Israeli Ministry of&#160;<br/>Justice refuses to release any information on what “necessity interrogations” entail. According to the Public&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
247<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=248></a>Committee Against Torture in Israel, at least 15 people in August and September 2019 were subjected to&#160;<br/>“necessity interrogations”.1440&#160;The UN Committee against Torture has expressed concern about Israel’s use&#160;<br/>of what it termed its “necessity defence”, and has reiterated that the “prohibition of torture is absolute and&#160;<br/>non-derogable and that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever may be invoked by a State party to justify&#160;<br/>acts of torture”.1441<br/>
Israeli legislation does not contain an absolute prohibition on torture&#160;and does not define torture and other&#160;<br/>ill-treatment as a crime,1442&#160;allowing for the practice to continue with impunity. While Israel’s Supreme Court&#160;<br/>in 1999 ruled that torture and other ill-treatment were generally prohibited, it permitted interrogators to use&#160;<br/>what the Court described as “physical interrogation methods” in “ticking bomb” situations, and allowed&#160;<br/>them to escape criminal liability or even investigations under the “defence of necessity”.1443&#160;The Supreme&#160;<br/>Court of Israel never interpreted or limited the scope of the so-called “ticking bomb” situation, leaving it to&#160;<br/>the discretion of the Israel Security Agency to broadly interpret the situation and implicitly to continue to use&#160;<br/>torture and other ill-treatment against Palestinian or “security suspects”.&#160;<br/>
Since the Supreme Court decision in 1999, Israeli interrogators have tortured hundreds of Palestinians, citing&#160;<br/>the “ticking bomb” plea, and not one of them has been prosecuted.1444&#160;According to the Public Committee&#160;<br/>Against Torture in Israel, between 2001 and 2020, over 1,300 complaints of torture were submitted to&#160;<br/>the Israeli Ministry of Justice, resulting in only two criminal investigations and no indictments.1445&#160;In 2021,&#160;<br/>several UN Special Rapporteurs called on Israel to end impunity for torture and other ill-treatment.1446<br/>
<b>6.2.3 PATTERN OF INHUMAN OR INHUMANE ACTS<br/></b>Israel’s widespread and systematic use of arbitrary arrest, administrative detention and torture on a large&#160;<br/>scale against Palestinians, in flagrant violation of several prohibitions&#160;under international law, forms part&#160;<br/>of the state’s policy of domination and control over the Palestinian population. Israel’s laws and policies of&#160;<br/>administrative detention and torture have therefore involved the crimes against humanity of “imprisonment&#160;<br/>or other severe deprivation of physical liberty” and “torture”, which are prohibited under the Rome Statute&#160;<br/>and the Apartheid Convention. When committed in the OPT, acts of torture and other ill-treatment are also&#160;<br/>war crimes.<br/>
<b>6.3 UNLAWFUL KILLINGS AND SERIOUS INJURIES &#160;<br/>6.3.1 RELEVANT CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW<br/></b>Under Article 7(1)(a) of the Rome Statute, “murder” is listed as a prohibited inhumane act, which may&#160;<br/>constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid when committed in the context of an institutionalized&#160;<br/>regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another, with the intention of&#160;<br/>maintaining that regime. The Apartheid Convention also lists the “murder of members of a racial groups&#160;<br/>or groups” as an inhuman act and a crime of apartheid when “committed for the purpose of establishing&#160;<br/>

<a name=249></a>and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and&#160;<br/>systematically oppressing them”.1447&#160;<br/>
By using the term “murder”, both the Apartheid Convention and the&#160;Rome Statute have specified that the&#160;<br/>killings have led to arbitrary deprivation of the right to life, which is protected under international human rights&#160;<br/>law,1448&#160;committed on a widespread or systematic basis as part of an “attack on a civilian population”, meaning&#160;<br/>there is some degree of planning or policy to commit the crime.1449&#160;Murder has been defined as the “the death&#160;<br/>of the victim which results from an act or omission by the accused, committed with the intent either to kill or to&#160;<br/>cause serious bodily harm with the reasonable knowledge that it would likely lead to death.”1450&#160;<br/>
Additionally, the Rome Statute criminalizes “[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally&#160;<br/>causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.”1451&#160;The Apartheid&#160;<br/>Convention prohibits the “infliction upon the members of a racial group&#160;or groups of serious bodily or mental&#160;<br/>harm, by the infringement of their freedom or dignity… “1452<br/>
Wilful killing and wilfully causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or health. also are listed as grave&#160;<br/>breaches under the Fourth Geneva Convention,1453&#160;and war crimes under the Rome Statute.1454&#160;International&#160;<br/>criminal tribunals have clarified that the term murder has an identical&#160;meaning to the war crime of wilful&#160;<br/>killing.1455&#160;The ICTY found that the “mental element” (<i>mens rea</i>), that is intent and knowledge of the act, is&#160;<br/>what distinguishes wilful killing from any other killing, providing that “there is demonstrated an intention on&#160;<br/>the part of the accused to kill, or inflict serious injury in reckless disregard to human life”.1456<br/>
<b>6.3.2 ISRAELI POLICIES AND PRACTICES<br/></b>Israeli forces have killed and injured thousands of Palestinian civilians in the OPT since 1967, often in&#160;<br/>circumstances suggesting that the killings were systematic, unlawful and arbitrary, and with near total&#160;<br/>impunity. Recent decades have seen a mounting toll of deaths and injuries of Palestinians as a result of&#160;<br/>shooting or other violence by Israeli soldiers outside the context of armed conflict in the OPT. In Israel,&#160;<br/>too, there has been a pattern of killings of Palestinian citizens of Israel in law enforcement activities in&#160;<br/>circumstances that indicate that the killings were unlawful.&#160;<br/>
According to B’Tselem, between September 2000 and February 2017 Israeli forces killed 4,868 Palestinians&#160;<br/>in the OPT, including 1,793 children, outside the context of armed conflict.1457&#160;Law enforcement activities&#160;<br/>in the OPT, such as supressing protests, carrying out raids to arrest people, enforcing travel and movement&#160;<br/>restrictions, and conducting search operations, stem from Israel’s administration of occupied territory.&#160;<br/>In conducting such activities, Israeli forces are exercising a policing function that is governed under&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=250></a>international human rights law.1458&#160;Policing activities against civilians during belligerent occupation may never&#160;<br/>be conducted like hostilities against combatants, as they do not meet the threshold of hostilities regulated&#160;<br/>by international humanitarian law.1459&#160;Both the Israeli army and the police, including the border police, have&#160;<br/>authority to carry out policing activities in the OPT; in East Jerusalem, however, only the Israeli police exercise such&#160;<br/>authority. The police, not the army, have policing powers in relation to Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.<br/>
In the context of Palestinian protests in the OPT, the conduct of Israeli forces appears to be intended to&#160;<br/>stifle dissent and freedom of expression. Palestinians frequently protest against Israeli occupation, as well&#160;<br/>as the policies and practices that underpin it, such as the blockade on Gaza, the creation and expansion&#160;<br/>of illegal settlements, land seizures, closures, arrests and detentions. The right to peaceful protest is of&#160;<br/>particular importance for Palestinians in the OPT, as they have no opportunity to influence the policy of the&#160;<br/>occupying power through voting or other such means. Israeli authorities, however, view such protests as&#160;<br/>a threat to security, and have since the beginning of its occupation criminalized them.1460&#160;During protests,&#160;<br/>demonstrators often resort to low-level violence, throwing stones and rocks at Israeli soldiers but without&#160;<br/>posing any serious risk to them due to the distance and the heavily protected nature of their positions.&#160;<br/>In return, Israeli forces use a wide variety of measures against the protesters. These include less lethal&#160;<br/>means such as tear gas, pepper spray, stun grenades (sound bombs) and hand-held batons. However,&#160;<br/>Israeli forces frequently resort to lethal means and fire rubber-coated metal bullets and live firearms&#160;<br/>ammunition at protesters, causing deaths and injuries. In some cases, they have also killed or injured&#160;<br/>demonstrators by firing tear gas directly at them from close range or&#160;by using tear gas in enclosed spaces&#160;<br/>causing asphyxiation. In many cases, Israeli forces have used unnecessary or excessive force, unlawfully&#160;<br/>killing hundreds of Palestinian protesters, including children, when there was no imminent threat to life and&#160;<br/>wounding thousands more often seriously. The pattern of unlawful killings&#160;and infliction of serious injuries&#160;<br/>against Palestinian demonstrators appears to be aimed at eliminating opposition to Israel’s policies and&#160;<br/>practices in the OPT. Amnesty International has documented this pattern over decades.1461&#160;Other human&#160;<br/>rights organizations have done similarly.1462<br/>
Israeli forces regularly obstruct and prevent medical personnel from providing medical care to injured&#160;<br/>protesters, contributing in some cases to their death.1463&#160;They have also attacked medics seeking to assist&#160;<br/>the wounded,1464&#160;and human rights defenders and journalists who are present to document abuses or report&#160;<br/>

Also well documented is the pattern of misuse of lethal force and firearms, including intentional lethal use&#160;<br/>of firearms, by Israeli forces against Palestinians during law enforcement operations in the OPT when there&#160;<br/>was no imminent threat to life or without exhausting less lethal means of neutralizing a perceived threat.1466&#160;&#160;<br/>Additionally, Israeli forces frequently and recklessly fire at or deploy&#160;less lethal weapons against bystanders,&#160;<br/>or damage property of nearby residents.1467<br/>
The Israeli authorities treat as classified information (for security reasons) the “rules of engagement” guidance&#160;<br/>issued to soldiers and border police to advise and instruct them as to when and in what circumstances they&#160;<br/>may resort to force, including lethal force, and what actions, if any, they must take beforehand – for example,&#160;<br/>to issue warnings.1468&#160;Some details about the rules have been shared on rare occasions.1469&#160;One such instance&#160;<br/>was when some details came to light about the open-fire regulations during the suppression of the Great&#160;<br/>March of Return protests in the Gaza Strip in 2018. Over a year into the protests, in July 2019, it emerged that&#160;<br/>the Israeli military had allowed and instructed Israeli snipers&#160;to fire at protesters’ lower limbs above the knee&#160;<br/>under their open-fire regulations. After it became clear that such regulations were leading needlessly to deaths&#160;<br/>and devastating injuries, snipers were briefed to aim below the knee.1470<br/>
In the OPT, Israeli forces have carried out unlawful killings, caused serious injuries of Palestinians, and&#160;<br/>damaged Palestinian property, with near total impunity. The Israeli military justice system has consistently&#160;<br/>failed to deliver justice for Palestinian victims of unlawful killings or serious injuries and their families.1471&#160;<br/>Amnesty International is not aware of any case in which an Israeli army soldier or member of another&#160;<br/>security force has been convicted of wilfully causing the death of a Palestinian in the OPT since 1987.&#160;<br/>Israeli soldiers and other security forces personnel have rarely been prosecuted at all in connection with the&#160;<br/>killings of Palestinians in the OPT, although many of the killings appear to have been unlawful. Convictions&#160;<br/>have been even rarer. When such convictions have occurred, soldiers have been convicted of manslaughter&#160;<br/>or lesser offences.1472&#160;In 2016, B’Tselem decided to stop referring cases of unlawful killings or injuries of&#160;<br/>Palestinians during law enforcement operations to the Israeli authorities for investigations after 25 years of&#160;<br/>doing so, because of the “ineffectuality” of the Israeli military justice system, which continues to cover up&#160;<br/>unlawful acts and protect perpetrators, rather than provide justice for victims.1473<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>
251<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=252></a>Senior Israeli officials have contributed to a culture of impunity by arguing&#160;in specific cases that killings&#160;<br/>and injuries during law enforcement operations were justified and carried out pursuant to orders, and that&#160;<br/>perpetrators should not be reprimanded or prosecuted.1474&#160;Some have even called on police and soldiers&#160;<br/>to kill Palestinians they suspect of attacking Israelis irrespective of whether lethal force is actually strictly&#160;<br/>necessary to protect life.1475<br/>
The pattern of unlawful killings and serious injuries inflicted by Israeli&#160;forces on Palestinians in the OPT is&#160;<br/>illustrated by the killing and wounding of Palestinian protesters during the Great March of Return in Gaza in 2018.<br/>
<b>GREAT MARCH OF RETURN IN GAZA</b><br/>
On 30 March 2018, Palestinians in Gaza, including refugees, launched the Great March of Return, a series&#160;<br/>of weekly mass demonstrations along the fence between Gaza and Israel to demand their right to return&#160;<br/>to their villages and towns in what is now Israel, and to press for an end to Israel’s blockade on Gaza.&#160;<br/>
Even before the protests began, senior Israeli officials publicly threatened that any Palestinian&#160;<br/>approaching the fence would be shot, and deployed snipers near the fence.1476&#160;In addition, Israeli officials&#160;<br/>have threatened, endorsed or encouraged the use of lethal force against protesters. Then defence&#160;<br/>minister Avigdor Lieberman warned protesters that they were “playing with their lives” before the&#160;<br/>protests began.1477&#160;He later said that Israeli soldiers on the Gaza border “did what was necessary”.1478&#160;&#160;<br/>
At least 17 Palestinians were killed and 5,500 others injured on the&#160;first day of protests on 30 March&#160;<br/>2018.1479&#160;During the demonstration, some Palestinian protesters approached the fence in a show of&#160;<br/>defiance. Amnesty International documented in April 2018 that many of the serious injuries were to&#160;<br/>the lower limbs, including the knees, causing serious bone and tissue damage, with large exit wounds&#160;<br/>measuring 10-15mm similar to war wounds.1480&#160;Doctors told Amnesty International that such serious&#160;<br/>injuries would likely face further complications, infections and some form of physical disability, such&#160;<br/>as paralysis or amputation. According to the international humanitarian organization Médecins Sans&#160;<br/>Frontières, half of the more than 500 patients admitted to its clinics on 1-19 April 2018 were treated for&#160;<br/>
1474.&#160;Former education minister Naftali Bennett responded to a question about the Israeli army using a shoot-to-kill policy on Palestinian&#160;<br/>
children along the fence that separates Gaza and Israel by saying, “They are not children ¬¬– they are terrorists. We are fooling ourselves.&#160;<br/>
I see the photos.” See Times of Israel, “Bennett says IDF should shoot to kill Gazans who cross border”, 8 October 2018,&#160;<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-says-idf-should-shoot-to-kill-gazans-who-cross-border/">timesofisrael.</a><br/>

Azaria, convicted of manslaughter in the deliberate killing of a wounded Palestinian, to be pardoned. Bennett said, “Today a soldier who&#160;<br/>
killed a terrorist who deserved to die, who tried to slaughter [another] soldier, was placed in shackles and convicted as a criminal.” See&#160;<br/>

injuries “where the bullet has literally destroyed tissue after having pulverized the bone”.1481&#160;The nature&#160;<br/>of these injuries shows that Israeli soldiers were using high-velocity military grade weapons designed to&#160;<br/>cause maximum harm.1482<br/>
Although the demonstrations were generally peaceful, there were individuals who threw stones and&#160;<br/>Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces and some launched incendiary kites and balloons into Israel, resulting&#160;<br/>in some fires, including of crops.&#160;<br/>
By the end of 2019, Israeli forces had killed 214 civilians, including 46 children, and injured over 8,000&#160;<br/>others with live ammunition. A total of 156 of those injured had to have limbs amputated, according to OCHA.&#160;<br/>More than 1,200 patients require long-term, complex and expensive therapy and rehabilitation, and tens&#160;<br/>of thousands more require psycho-social support, neither of which the resources in Gaza can provide.1483&#160;<br/>

and three other Palestinian paramedics moved closer to the fence to provide medical assistance to two&#160;<br/>injured protesters. All four held their hands up in the air, indicating that they meant no harm.1485&#160;Neither&#160;<br/>she nor her colleagues posed any threat to Israeli forces. Razan Al-Najjar was transferred to hospital,&#160;<br/>where she was pronounced dead at approximately 7.10pm.1486<br/>
Amnesty International had interviewed Razan Al-Najjar six weeks earlier, on 16 April 2018, while&#160;<br/>documenting cases of paramedics and medical workers who had been injured by live ammunition or&#160;<br/>tear gas inhalation during the protests. She told Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>I am here in the field from 7am until 10pm with my team. We paid with our own money from&#160;<br/>our pockets for the supplies we are using. Our team yesterday was intensely targeted. We were&#160;<br/>targeted with tear gas in this tent right here, in the middle of the tent where we are now. There are&#160;<br/>so many critical injuries, like cases of amputations of the limbs and direct head injuries. Instead of&#160;<br/>support or help… we get targeted instead by the Israeli army. I have been injured four times, and&#160;<br/>even until now I am still getting injuries.1487&#160;&#160;</i><br/>
On 5 June 2018, during an initial examination of the killing, the Israeli military found that no shots&#160;<br/>were deliberately or directly aimed towards Razan Al-Najjar.1488&#160;On 29 October 2018, the Israeli Military&#160;<br/>Advocate General rejected the findings and ordered the military police to open a criminal investigation –&#160;<br/>almost five months after she was killed.1489&#160;The results of the investigation have yet to be made public.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International believes that Razan Al-Najjar was wilfully killed, a grave breach of the Geneva&#160;<br/>Conventions and a war crime.<br/>

<b>Adham Al-Hajjar</b><br/>
Adham Al-Hajjar is a freelance journalist and lives in Gaza City. On 6 April 2018, while he was covering&#160;<br/>the Great March of Return demonstrations, Israeli snipers positioned along the fence separating Gaza&#160;<br/>from Israel shot him. The bullet hit his left knee, splintering the bone and damaging muscles and the&#160;<br/>femoral nerve. He told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>I went down to the fence like any other day to cover the demonstrations at Al-Malaka. At around&#160;<br/>2pm or 3pm I was wearing my press jacket and helmet and I remember I wanted to take a photo&#160;<br/>of a demonstrator near the fence. I went to take the photo, and the second I lifted my camera&#160;<br/>the next thing I remember was fainting and then realizing I was shot. I kept going in and out of&#160;<br/>consciousness. Luckily there was another photographer who carried&#160;me to the field medic and&#160;<br/>then to Al-Shifa Hospital. I was wearing my press jacket and clearly holding a camera, and the&#160;<br/>snipers could see this. This same day… they killed journalist Yasser Murtaja and shot and injured&#160;<br/>another journalist.1490&#160;</i><br/>
Adham Al-Hajjar has had a series of operations in Gaza, Egypt and Jordan since his injury. He continues&#160;<br/>to suffer from partial paralysis of his foot, and requires a knee replacement and ankle surgery. He is&#160;<br/>unable to obtain the medical help he needs in Gaza because of the debilitated health services there, and&#160;<br/>Israel will not allow him to travel elsewhere. He told Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>I barely sleep any more. My leg hurts&#160;<br/>every night, the pain is always there. I&#160;<br/>wake up in the morning and walk to my&#160;<br/>friend’s house close by to drink coffee.&#160;<br/>I need to do this just to leave my room&#160;<br/>and to move around or else all I am left&#160;<br/>with is my mind, and thinking, and it is&#160;<br/>debilitating...&#160;</i><br/>
<i>The bullet that entered my leg did&#160;<br/>not just enter and leave my body. It&#160;<br/>entered and stopped everything; it&#160;<br/>stopped my life. I look back at the last&#160;<br/>three years and ask what have I done?&#160;<br/>Nothing. What has progressed&#160;in my&#160;<br/>life? Nothing. Just because a soldier&#160;<br/>pulled the trigger without thinking of&#160;<br/>how it would devastate my life. Not just&#160;<br/>my life, but my family’s life. Did he or&#160;<br/>she ever think about what this would&#160;<br/>cause? The pain, the loss. I am walking&#160;<br/>around as a dead man, everything in&#160;<br/>my life froze from the moment that&#160;<br/>bullet entered my leg.1491</i><br/>

<a name=256></a>Over recent decades, Israeli forces and security agents have killed dozens of Palestinian citizens and&#160;<br/>residents of Israel in law enforcement activities in circumstances that indicate that the killings were unlawful.&#160;<br/>These have taken place in the context of the policing protests against discriminatory Israeli policies and&#160;<br/>actions in Israel and the OPT and during other, often discriminatory, law enforcement activities. The&#160;<br/>perpetrators of the violence have enjoyed near total impunity. This pattern is illustrated by Israeli state killings&#160;<br/>of Palestinian citizens and residents of Israel between 2000 and 2017.<br/>
<b>STATE KILLINGS OF PALESTINIANS IN ISRAEL, 2000-2017&#160;</b><br/>
Israeli forces and security agents continue to kill unlawfully Palestinian citizens of Israel, including in the&#160;<br/>context of protests against discriminatory Israeli policies and actions in Israel and the OPT and in other,&#160;<br/>often discriminatory, law enforcement activities. Such a pattern is possible because of the near total&#160;<br/>impunity that perpetrators of such violations enjoy.&#160;<br/>
In 2000, Amnesty International documented the killing of 13 Palestinians, most of them citizens of&#160;<br/>Israel, by police and other security forces in Israel and East Jerusalem between 29 September and 8&#160;<br/>October 2000,1492&#160;as well as the injury of hundreds of others and the arrest of more than 600 people&#160;<br/>in protests across Israel against Israeli policies in the OPT at the beginning of the second&#160;<i>intifada</i>.1493&#160;<br/>A commission of inquiry into the killings,1494&#160;established by the Israeli government, found in 2003 that&#160;<br/>there was no justification for the killings. Despite this, in 2008 the Israeli attorney general closed the&#160;<br/>investigations into the killings without finding any wrongdoing or indicting any officer.1495<br/>
According to the Mossawa Center, between October 2008 and May 2021 Israeli police killed more than&#160;<br/>45 Palestinian citizens of Israel. The organization also documented three cases of Israeli police killing&#160;<br/>unarmed Palestinian residents of Israel in the same period. A further 15 Palestinian citizens were killed&#160;<br/>by Jewish citizens and private security agents. The combined total of 63 does not include Palestinian&#160;<br/>citizens killed in what the authorities classify as “security incidents”. According to the Mossawa Center,&#160;<br/>only two police officers were convicted in cases of killings during this period.1496<br/>
An investigation by Sikha Mekomit, a Hebrew-language media organization, published in January 2019,&#160;<br/>revealed that in the previous five years the Israeli police had killed 14&#160;citizens of Israel, of whom nine&#160;<br/>were Palestinians, one was of Ethiopian origin and the rest had “Middle Eastern surnames”. According&#160;<br/>to the report, the incidents were not security related and no perpetrator was held accountable for the&#160;<br/>killings.1497&#160;<br/>
On 7 November 2014, Israeli police shot and killed Kheir Hamdan, 22, in Kafr Kanna in northern Israel&#160;<br/>after he had approached a police vehicle following the arrest of another man from the village. According&#160;<br/>to Adalah, Kheir Hamdan banged on the police vehicle’s windows with an object and then ran away&#160;<br/>

1494.&#160;Following public pressure, the Israeli government established the Commission of Inquiry into the Clashes between Security Forces&#160;<br/>
and Israeli Citizens in October 2000, also known as the Or Commission, in November 2000, to “investigate the clashes with security&#160;<br/>
forces... in which Jewish and Arab Israeli citizens were killed and wounded.” The Commission’s mandate did not extend to examining acts&#160;<br/>
of torture or ill-treatment carried out on those arrested by security forces in connection with the demonstrations in Israel. See Amnesty&#160;<br/>

<a name=257></a>when the officers got out. The officers shot Kheir Hamdan while he was&#160;running away and not posing&#160;<br/>an imminent threat to lives.1498&#160;Mahash, the internal investigation unit at the Ministry of Justice, closed&#160;<br/>the complaint. Following a petition to the Supreme Court, the Court&#160;asked the State Attorney Office to&#160;<br/>consider interrogating only one of the policemen who had shot Kheir Hamdan and mistreated him while&#160;<br/>he was injured. No indictment was filed.1499&#160;&#160;<br/>
In the early morning of 18 January 2017, Israeli police shot at 47-year-old teacher Yaqoub Abu Al-<br/>Qi’an in the village of Umm Al-Hiran in the Negev/Naqab while he was driving back from his mother’s&#160;<br/>house during a raid by the Israeli forces to carry out demolition orders against homes and structures&#160;<br/>in the village. As a result, Yaqoub Abu Al-Qi’an lost control of his vehicle, inadvertently striking and&#160;<br/>killing a policeman. Even though Yaqoub Abu Al-Qi’an had already sustained a gunshot injury, the&#160;<br/>police again opened fire on him with live ammunition, assuming that&#160;the loss of control of the car was&#160;<br/>an intentional attack. Bleeding in the car, the police prevented paramedics from helping Yaqoub Abu&#160;<br/>Al-Qi’an for three hours.1500&#160;The forensic investigation concluded that he bled for about 30 minutes&#160;<br/>before dying, indicating that he would have lived if he had received proper medical treatment. Public&#160;<br/>statements made at the time by Israeli minister Gilad Erdan1501&#160;and police commissioner Peretz&#160;<br/>Ammar1502&#160;described Yaqoub Abu Al-Qi’an as a terrorist and a radical Islamist who had wanted to kill the&#160;<br/>policemen. The Israeli police held his body for a week and released it after a Supreme Court hearing that&#160;<br/>allowed only a conditional burial,1503&#160;which limited the number of people who could attend.1504&#160;<br/>
A comprehensive analysis and study of the available footage and recordings by the Forensic Architecture&#160;<br/>group found that Yaqoub Abu Al-Qi’an was shot despite not posing any imminent threat to security&#160;<br/>forces or others.1505&#160;Yet, the Israeli State Prosecutor officially closed the investigation by&#160;the&#160;Israeli&#160;<br/>police into what appears to have been an extrajudicial execution, and cleared the officers involved&#160;<br/>of any misconduct, even though a department in the Israeli Ministry of Justice had found police&#160;<br/>misconduct.1506&#160; Adalah and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel petitioned against the&#160;<br/>decision to close the investigation and, as of the end of August 2021, were awaiting an outcome.1507<br/>
The culture of impunity in relation to state killings in Israel sits within a broader lack of accountability&#160;<br/>for police violence in the country. Between 2011 and 2013, according to a study by Adalah, 11,282&#160;<br/>complaints of police harassment and brutality were filed with Mahash,&#160;the internal investigation unit at&#160;<br/>

<a name=258></a>the Ministry of Justice. The report found that Mahash closed 93% of the complaints; only 3.3% of the&#160;<br/>cases filed (373 complaints) led to disciplinary action against police&#160;officers, and only 2.7% (306 files)&#160;<br/>led to criminal prosecution.1508<br/>
A report by the State Comptroller in 2017 found serious deficiencies&#160;with regards to accountability for&#160;<br/>violations by police officers. It stated that while the unit receives thousands of complaints a year, many&#160;<br/>are not investigated at all and only dozens lead to disciplinary action or criminal proceedings.1509<br/>
The persistent failure of Israeli authorities to punish the perpetrators and hold them accountable&#160;<br/>perpetuates a culture of police violence particularly against Palestinian citizens of Israel.<br/>
<b>6.3.3 PATTERN OF INHUMAN OR INHUMANE ACTS<br/></b>Patterns of excessive use of force against Palestinians during law enforcement operations, information&#160;<br/>available about the Israeli military’s “rules of engagement”, as well as&#160;Israeli officials’ statements on&#160;<br/>responding to such operations particularly during protests, reflect a planned and persistent policy of&#160;<br/>shooting to kill or maim Palestinians. The policy has led to the killing of thousands of Palestinians and the&#160;<br/>wounding of hundreds of thousands, many of whom have been left with permanent, catastrophic and often&#160;<br/>life-changing injuries.<br/>
These practices are consistent with the inhuman and inhumane acts of “murder” and “other inhumane acts&#160;<br/>of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical&#160;<br/>health”1510&#160;or the “infliction upon the members of a racial group or groups&#160;of serious bodily or mental harm”&#160;<br/>enumerated in the Rome Statute and the Apartheid Convention.<br/>
Additionally, under international humanitarian law, Palestinians in the OPT are “protected persons” entitled&#160;<br/>to special protection and humane treatment at all times.1511&#160;As such, the intentional and unjustified killing&#160;<br/>and injury of Palestinians in the OPT during law enforcement operations may amount to the war crimes of&#160;<br/>wilful killing or wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health.<br/>

<a name=259></a><b>6.4 DENIAL OF BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND&#160;</b><br/>
<b>PERSECUTION &#160;<br/>6.4.1 RELEVANT CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW<br/></b>The Apartheid Convention identifies acts listed in Article II(c), which defines the crime of apartheid, as including:<br/>
<i>Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from&#160;<br/>participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation&#160;<br/>of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in particular by denying to&#160;<br/>members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to work,&#160;<br/>the right to form recognized trade unions, the right to education, the right to leave and to return to their&#160;<br/>country, the right to a nationality, the right to freedom of movement and residence, the right to freedom&#160;<br/>of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.&#160;</i><br/>
The acts enumerated in Article II(c) appear to follow and complement the list of rights guaranteed under&#160;<br/>Article 5 of the ICERD, reinforcing the fundamental responsibility of states parties in guaranteeing the&#160;<br/>enjoyment of these rights through the prohibition and elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms.&#160;<br/>Further, the list of acts is intended to be “illustrative and inclusive rather than comprehensive and exclusive”,&#160;<br/>meaning that not all these rights need to be violated in order to establish the crime of apartheid. Other&#160;<br/>prohibited acts found in Article 5 of the ICERD might be considered if they are relevant to preventing&#160;<br/>“participation” and “full development” of the racial group.1512&#160;&#160;<br/>
The Rome Statute provides that crimes against humanity (which include apartheid) may involve “… other&#160;<br/>inhumane acts of a similar character [to those provided elsewhere in Article 7(1)] intentionally causing great&#160;<br/>suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.”1513&#160;This provision, which was included in&#160;<br/>the statutes of previous international tribunals,1514&#160;is designed to ensure that acts not explicitly criminalized in&#160;<br/>Article 7(1) but similar to them in “nature and gravity”1515&#160;are not excluded.1516<br/>
Several scholars have maintained that for the purposes of acts constituting the crime of apartheid, the acts&#160;<br/>listed in Article II(c) of the Apartheid Convention may fall under Article 7(1)(k) (“other inhumane acts”) of&#160;<br/>the Rome Statute, in conjunction with its Article 7(1)(j) (“apartheid”). In this context, experts on the Rome&#160;<br/>Statute have explained why these acts enumerated in Article II(c) may be considered, in the context of&#160;<br/>apartheid, as crimes against humanity:&#160;<br/>
<i>Although some may contend that some of the other acts listed in Article II, such as the denial of the&#160;<br/>right to work or to education, although of course, very serious deprivations, are not of the same nature&#160;<br/>as the acts listed in Article 7, para.1, this contention overlooks the devastating impact on the lives of&#160;<br/>those denied these rights recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by&#160;<br/>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and on society deprived of the full&#160;<br/>potential of its members.1517&#160;&#160;</i><br/>

Article II(c), of “denying to members of a racial group… basic human rights” roughly covers the specific violations and crimes addressed&#160;<br/>
in this section, bearing in mind that causing malnutrition involves violating “basic” human rights such as to an adequate standard of living,&#160;<br/>

1514.&#160;The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber distinguished the Rome Statute’s provision for “other inhumane acts” from that of previous tribunals&#160;<br/>
by stating that, unlike them, Article 7(2)(k) is not a “catch-all provision” but rather “contains certain limitations, as regards to the action&#160;<br/>
constituting an inhumane act and the consequence required as a result of that action.” See ICC,&#160;<i>Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo</i>, Case&#160;<br/>

<a name=260></a>The “intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the&#160;<br/>identity of the group or collectivity”1518&#160;on “political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious,&#160;gender… or&#160;<br/>other grounds that are recognized as impermissible under international law”1519&#160;constitutes the crime against&#160;<br/>humanity of persecution, as per the Rome Statute, when committed in the context of other Rome Statute crimes.&#160;<br/>
<b>6.4.2 ISRAELI POLICIES AND PRACTICES<br/></b>hAs analysed in Chapter 5, Israel imposes a wide range of discriminatory and exclusionary laws, policies and&#160;<br/>practices against the civilian Palestinian population that have clear – and foreseeable – consequences for the&#160;<br/>enjoyment of human rights and amount to “deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development”&#160;<br/>of Palestinian communities in Israel and more acutely in the OPT. Some of these discriminatory laws extend to&#160;<br/>Palestinian refugees, who were formerly citizens of British mandate Palestine, and their descendants, residing&#160;<br/>in the OPT or outside Israel and the OPT. While some of the violations are the direct result of official&#160;policy and&#160;<br/>conduct, others result from more “downstream” and indirect consequences, where policies severely impede the&#160;<br/>enjoyment of other rights, including economic, social and cultural rights.&#160;<br/>
The systematic denial of the right to a nationality and severe restrictions imposed by Israel on movement&#160;<br/>and residence, including the right to leave and to return to one’s country, go beyond what is justifiable under&#160;<br/>international law. Their sweeping application has targeted the Palestinian population in a discriminatory&#160;<br/>manner on the basis of their racialized identity as Palestinians. Thus, these restrictions obstruct Palestinians’&#160;<br/>participation in political, social, economic and cultural life in Israel and the OPT and deliberately prevent their&#160;<br/>full development as a group. These restrictions further undermine the enjoyment of a host of basic rights&#160;<br/>and freedoms, including the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly&#160;<br/>and association, livelihood, work, health, food and education, as has been demonstrated in this report.&#160;<br/>Beyond that, Israel has also imposed laws and policies that have restricted the enjoyment of these rights and&#160;<br/>contributed to the “deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development” of Palestinians.&#160;<br/>
Israel denies Palestinian refugees outside Israel and the OPT the right to citizenship and prevents them from&#160;<br/>returning to their homes. This is a serious violation of Palestinian refugees’ “right to leave and to return to their&#160;<br/>country, the right to a nationality, the right to freedom of movement and residence”1520&#160;and, committed as it has&#160;<br/>been as part of the system of oppression and domination, the violation amounts to an inhuman or inhumane&#160;<br/>act under respectively the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. In addition, by violating these rights&#160;<br/>Israel prevents Palestinian refugees from “participating in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the&#160;<br/>country,” which appears intended to ensure that Palestinians with the right to vote remain a minority within Israel.<br/>
The case of Mustafa Al-Kharouf, who together with his family has been trying to legalize his status in East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem for over 22 years, first as a child and then as an adult, exemplifies the wide-ranging impact of&#160;<br/>Israel’s discriminatory citizenship and status policies on the fundamental rights of those affected who are&#160;<br/>unable to lead a normal life.&#160;<br/>
<b>MUSTAFA AL-KHAROUF</b><br/>
Mustafa Al-Kharouf is a Palestinian photojournalist who was born to an Algerian mother and a&#160;<br/>Palestinian Jerusalemite father. He lives in occupied East Jerusalem with his wife, Tamam Al-Kharouf,&#160;<br/>and their children Asia, Iyad and Iyas. Israel denies Mustafa Al-Kharouf the right to live in Jerusalem and&#160;<br/>maintains a threat to deport him. Israel’s measures deny him his right to reside within his own country,&#160;<br/>freedom of movement, access to health, and the right to work.&#160;<br/>

<a name=261></a>Mustafa Al-Kharouf moved to East Jerusalem with his family from Algeria when he was 12. Soon after&#160;<br/>the family returned to East Jerusalem, they submitted family unification requests with Israeli authorities,&#160;<br/>requesting a legal status to reside in the city. However, they were subjected to the “centre of life”&#160;<br/>condition that the Israeli authorities have applied in a discriminatory manner to Palestinian Jerusalemites&#160;<br/>since 1988. Mustafa Al-Kharouf’s family had to wait six years before meeting that condition. By the time&#160;<br/>they met the condition, Mustafa Al-Kharouf had turned 18 and his family was unable to apply for child&#160;<br/>registration or family unification on his behalf, rendering him stateless.<br/>
Mustafa Al-Kharouf then started a long legal battle with the Israeli Ministry of Interior to validate&#160;<br/>his legal status in East Jerusalem. He holds a temporary Jordanian travel document, which Jordan&#160;<br/>issues for stateless Palestinians living in East Jerusalem. He was also granted a temporary work visa&#160;<br/>by Israeli authorities on humanitarian grounds, but this was only valid from 27 October 2014 to 1&#160;<br/>October 2015.&#160;<br/>
In June 2016, the Israeli Ministry of Interior refused to renew his work visa citing “security reasons”.&#160;<br/>His lawyer, Adi Lustigman, from the Israeli human rights organization HaMoked, believed that the&#160;<br/>ministry’s rejection was related to his work as a photojournalist documenting human rights abuses by&#160;<br/>the Israeli authorities in East Jerusalem. In May 2017, Mustafa Al-Kharouf’s lawyer filed an appeal at a&#160;<br/>court of appeal. After negotiations, the Ministry of Interior allowed him to submit an application for family&#160;<br/>unification and to stay at his home in East Jerusalem until a decision&#160;was made. However, the ministry&#160;<br/>rejected his application for family unification on 23 December 2018. The decision, according to his&#160;<br/>lawyer, was based on an unsupported claim that Mustafa Al-Kharouf is an activist with Hamas and that&#160;<br/>he is engaged in illegal activity.1521&#160;<br/>
On 21 January 2019, Mustafa Al-Kharouf’s lawyer appealed the decision rejecting the family unification&#160;<br/>request. A few hours later, at approximately 1am on 22 January 2019, Israeli police and immigration&#160;<br/>inspectors, acting on a Ministry of Interior deportation order, raided his home and arrested him. He&#160;<br/>was held in Givon prison in the Negev/Naqab inside Israel, in contravention of international law. On 3&#160;<br/>April 2019, an Israeli district court rejected Mustafa Al-Kharouf’s appeal regarding the family unification&#160;<br/>request. However, the court gave an interim order not to deport him so he could bring his case before&#160;<br/>the Supreme Court.<br/>
During the night of 21-22 July 2019, Israeli immigration authorities took Mustafa Al-Kharouf from&#160;<br/>Givon prison and attempted to deport him to Jordan through the Allenby/King Hussein crossing,&#160;<br/>but Jordanian authorities refused him entry. He was then taken to the Wadi Araba crossing, where&#160;<br/>Jordanian authorities again refused him entry. This deportation attempt lasted over half of a day during&#160;<br/>which Mustafa Al-Kharouf’s whereabouts were unknown to either his family or his lawyer. Mustafa Al-<br/>Kharouf’s lawyer was later informed that he was being taken back to Givon prison to be held in custody&#160;<br/>“pending deportation”.&#160;<br/>
On 25 September 2019, the Israeli Tribunal for Review of Custody of Illegal Aliens ruled that Mustafa&#160;<br/>Al-Kharouf must be released if he was not deported within a month. On 24 October 2019, Mustafa&#160;<br/>Al-Kharouf was released from detention after spending nine months in prison. Under the terms of&#160;<br/>his release he had only 21 days to obtain a legal status to reside in East Jerusalem or else leave the&#160;<br/>country.1522&#160;His lawyer asked for an extension.&#160;<br/>

<a name=262></a>Mustafa Al-Kharouf currently holds a temporary permit of residence that must be renewed every three&#160;<br/>months.1523&#160;The visa allows him to travel between East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and Israel,&#160;<br/>but he is unable to work or access healthcare under Israel’s national health insurance schemes. As each&#160;<br/>expiry date approaches the anxiety heightens for him and his family. His wife, Tamam Al-Kharouf, told&#160;<br/>Amnesty International:<br/>
<i>It&#160;hasn’t&#160;been&#160;easy.&#160;I&#160;thought&#160;the&#160;worst&#160;part&#160;was&#160;over&#160;when&#160;he&#160;was&#160;finally&#160;released&#160;from&#160;prison,&#160;but&#160;<br/>it is not. Mustafa hasn’t been handling this well; my husband is still being treated as if he was a&#160;<br/>visitor and not a resident of his city… He’s been accused of being an activist for Hamas, whatever&#160;<br/>this means. And these were the grounds they relied on to reject our&#160;family reunification request&#160;<br/>once again… To be honest, I am a little at ease because his deportation is no longer an option&#160;<br/>since the countries they want to deport him to are refusing to allow it. I mean now, our worst-case&#160;<br/>scenario is that we move to a place like Kufr Aqab, which is problematic to be honest. It will be&#160;<br/>difficult for Mustafa, as I’ll be able to move freely, while he will be limited and stuck – regarding&#160;<br/>commuting, accessing health facilities, and being able to do his job as a photojournalist.1524&#160;</i><br/>
Mustafa Al-Kharouf told Amnesty International:&#160;<br/>
<i>There is no way out. I try to normalize my situation as much as possible or else I will go crazy or&#160;<br/>depressed. I do everything with an expiry date on it, whether they are my visas, my activities, my&#160;<br/>movement. According to my release terms, I have to be home by 10pm and could leave only after&#160;<br/>5am every day. I never put myself in a position of risk; this risk would entail being caught and sent&#160;<br/>back to prison just because that day an Israeli authority figure might&#160;stop me randomly at a “flying&#160;<br/>checkpoint” or during a random search and ask for my papers… and require me having to explain&#160;<br/>my situation from scratch for them for hours and hours. I avoid these situations; I rarely ever go&#160;<br/>to the West Bank just so I don’t have to deal with soldiers at Qalandia checkpoint. I’ve left one big&#160;<br/>prison to enter another or if we’re being more accurate, I was always in prison – it just changed&#160;<br/>form a little.1525</i><br/>
Mustafa Al-Kharouf and his family last submitted a family reunification request in May 2020. The&#160;<br/>Ministry of Interior rejected it in December 2020 again based on allegations that he posed a “security&#160;<br/>threat” to Israel. The family appealed, but on 30 May 2021 Mustafa&#160;Al-Kharouf’s lawyer notified him&#160;<br/>that this had been rejected on security grounds based on secret information. He spoke to Amnesty&#160;<br/>International after receiving the news: &#160;<br/>
<i>I do not understand this logic, or lack of it. I could understand them beating me, shooting me,&#160;<br/>detaining me, as they have done, due to my work, but cannot understand the rationale of holding&#160;<br/>secret evidence against me and keeping on flipping my life upside-down&#160;every few months just&#160;<br/>because they can. I want to tell my lawyer to ask them to make sure that I am the person in&#160;<br/>question, to double-check if they have me mixed up with someone else, or to ask them to at least&#160;<br/>let me know how they’ve affiliated me with Hamas for example, or am doing work that somehow&#160;<br/>displeases the State of Israel. I wish I could get to meet face to face with whoever it is sitting&#160;<br/>behind a desk and making these irrational decisions about my life. I need some kind of logic to&#160;<br/>understand my situation, because none of this makes any sense.1526</i><br/>

<b>6.4.3 PATTERN OF INHUMAN OR INHUMANE ACTS<br/></b>Israeli authorities’ intent to commit the crime against humanity of persecution is evident from their long-<br/>standing discriminatory laws, policies and practices against the Palestinian population in the OPT that&#160;<br/>have resulted in numerous restrictions on fundamental rights, including arbitrarily restricting Palestinians’&#160;<br/>freedom of movement and residence in their communities, their right to family life, and their rights to access&#160;<br/>livelihoods, housing, food, water, essential healthcare services and education. These serious violations have&#160;<br/>been committed in the context of the multiple commission of crimes under the Rome Statute within the&#160;<br/>territory of Israel and the OPT. In almost every instance, the persecution faced by the Palestinian population&#160;<br/>tracks the acts of persecution enumerated in Article II(c) of the Apartheid Convention.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has therefore concluded that, at least as regards the denial of human rights of the&#160;<br/>Palestinian population through years of deliberate discriminatory and&#160;exclusionary policies and official Israeli&#160;<br/>statements that are reflected in practice, Israeli authorities have committed the crime against humanity&#160;<br/>of, or other inhumane act similar to, “persecution” within the meaning of the Rome Statute and “denial&#160;<br/>of basic human rights” that “prevent the racial group or groups from participation in the political, social,&#160;<br/>economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing [its or their] full&#160;<br/>development” under the Apartheid Convention.&#160;<br/>
<b>6.5 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND INTENT TO&#160;</b><br/>
<b>COMMIT APARTHEID &#160;<br/></b>Israeli authorities justify on security grounds many of the policies presented in this report, including&#160;<br/>policies of land confiscation, denial of building and planning permits, residency revocations, restrictions&#160;<br/>of movement, and violations of civil and political rights. It is true that the State of Israel has an obligation&#160;<br/>

<a name=264></a>under international law to protect all persons within its jurisdiction and control from violence, and therefore&#160;<br/>has a duty to ensure security within all territories that it controls. In the context of an international armed&#160;<br/>conflict and a military occupation there may be circumstances where treating different groups differently is&#160;<br/>based on lawful grounds and this may therefore occur in a manner that does not infringe the prohibition of&#160;<br/>discrimination. Indeed, as set out above, international humanitarian law allows, and in certain circumstances&#160;<br/>requires, nationals of the occupying power and the occupied population to be treated differently. However,&#160;<br/>security-related policies must comply with international law, including by ensuring any limitations or&#160;<br/>restrictions to rights are necessary and proportionate to the security threat. As this report illustrates, Israeli&#160;<br/>authorities have, on the contrary, pursued policies that deliberately discriminate against Palestinians over a&#160;<br/>prolonged period and in a particularly cruel manner in ways that have no reasonable basis in security, but&#160;<br/>which can be explained much more readily as consequent to an intent to control the Palestinian people and&#160;<br/>exploit their resources.&#160;<br/>
Firstly, many of the violations that are documented in this report simply have no justification in security or&#160;<br/>“defence”. The prolonged and cruel discriminatory denial of Palestinians’ access to their land and property&#160;<br/>that was seized in a violent and discriminatory manner has no security rationale. There is no security basis for&#160;<br/>the effective segregation of Palestinian citizens of Israel through discriminatory laws on planning and access to&#160;<br/>housing. The denial of their rights to claim their property and homes seized under the authority of racist laws,&#160;<br/>or to move into and reside wherever they wish, including in what have been designated as exclusively Jewish&#160;<br/>communities, is more likely to lead to security challenges than to encourage harmonious relations.&#160;<br/>
Other violations against the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel also fall short of a link to security. Arbitrary&#160;<br/>and discriminatory interference with the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to marry and extend rights of&#160;<br/>residence to their spouses and children, in the absence of evidence that particular individuals pose a threat,&#160;<br/>cannot be justified on security grounds.1527&#160;There is no security justification for the bifurcation of nationality&#160;<br/>and citizenship within Israel and the limitations that this imposes on Palestinians in exercising their rights.&#160;<br/>The real reason for these violations and the intention for the differential action must be sought elsewhere.&#160;<br/>
Secondly, and as seen above, differential treatment in occupied territories cannot be tolerated where the&#160;<br/>intention of the difference is to privilege the nationals of the occupying power to the lasting detriment of&#160;<br/>the occupied population. As established above, certain limitations on human rights may be permissible in&#160;<br/>situations of occupation, and thus administrative detention in East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank or&#160;<br/>the Gaza Strip may be justifiable under international law if conducted&#160;in good faith and adhering to the law of&#160;<br/>occupation. However, this justification for the differential treatment cannot extend to the settlement of Jewish&#160;<br/>Israelis, whether with the tacit consent or active support of the State of Israel, in the occupied territories. It&#160;<br/>cannot extend to the murders, the targeted killings, the torture, the deportation and other forcible transfer of&#160;<br/>populations that have been perpetrated in the OPT and documented in this report.&#160;<br/>
Thirdly, while some policies that have the effect of discriminating against Palestinians may have been&#160;<br/>designed to fulfil legitimate security objectives, they have been implemented in a blanket manner and for&#160;<br/>prolonged periods, thus failing to comply with international law. For example, this report details Israel’s&#160;<br/>policies towards Palestinians in Gaza following the withdrawal of settlers and troops in 2005 and during the&#160;<br/>time the territory has been under the de facto administration of Hamas. The report illustrates how policies&#160;<br/>of sweeping, severe and long-term restrictions on freedom of movement, for example, have no security&#160;<br/>justification. Meanwhile, certain policies, such as the creation of access-restricted zones around Gaza, both&#160;<br/>on land and in the sea, may have been designed for a legitimate security purpose, namely to prevent Hamas&#160;<br/>from using these areas to launch attacks against Israelis. However, their implementation over a prolonged&#160;<br/>period has resulted in systematic violations of human rights. This report shows that the policy to maintain&#160;<br/>these zones has resulted in systematic violations of human rights with severe impact on the livelihoods of&#160;<br/>Palestinians, particularly farmers and fishermen who are violently denied&#160;access to agricultural land and&#160;<br/>fishing waters within them.&#160;<br/>
1527.&#160;In other words, the differential treatment is not proportionate to any legitimate aim of the state (including the legitimate&#160;aim of&#160;<br/>
ensuring the security of the state and its nationals).&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=265></a>The report provides other examples of such Israeli policies, including the declaration of closed military&#160;<br/>zones, the use of administrative detention, and the imposition of certain restrictions on movement such as&#160;<br/>travel bans and blocking access to certain areas. Taken out of context, these could be seen as grounded in&#160;<br/>legitimate security concerns. However, examined in the context of systematic discrimination and oppression,&#160;<br/>and in the light of the mass human rights violations these policies have entailed, it becomes clear that the&#160;<br/>element of genuine security considerations has been far outweighed by the clear, and illegitimate, intent&#160;<br/>to dominate and oppress. The report demonstrates that these policies, while justified by Israel on security&#160;<br/>grounds, have consistently been implemented in a grossly disproportionate and discriminatory manner,&#160;<br/>resulting in mass, systematic violation of Palestinians’ human rights.&#160;<br/>
Consequently, security is not a viable explanation for the prolonged and cruel discrimination to which&#160;<br/>Palestinians have been subjected. Instead, the evidence of widespread, systematic and cruel violations&#160;<br/>documented in this report leads to the conclusion that the intention is to ensure Jewish Israeli domination over&#160;<br/>and oppression of Palestinians in all areas under Israel’s control. This intention can be inferred from Israel’s&#160;<br/>systematic privileging of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians in all geographical&#160;territories under its control, by its&#160;<br/>discriminatory denial of the right of return to all Palestinian refugees, by the illegal settlement of its citizens&#160;<br/>in the occupied territories and its exploitation of the resources there, and by its illegal annexation of East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem and extension of lesser rights to Palestinians living there compared to Israeli citizens.&#160;<br/>
<b>6.6 CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY OF APARTHEID &#160;<br/></b>This chapter has demonstrated that Palestinians have been subjected to acts proscribed under customary&#160;<br/>international law and by both the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute, in Israel and the OPT and in&#160;<br/>all situations where Israel exercises control over Palestinians’ enjoyment of their rights. Where these serious&#160;<br/>human rights violations are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed at a civilian&#160;<br/>population pursuant to or in furtherance of a state or organizational policy, and with the intention to maintain&#160;<br/>the systematic, cruel and prolonged control of the Palestinians to the benefit of Jewish Israelis, these amount&#160;<br/>to crimes against humanity of apartheid.<br/>
The evidence set out demonstrates that multiple (indeed a multitude) of proscribed acts have been committed&#160;<br/>in Israel and the OPT and against Palestinians whose rights are under the control of Israel. These serious&#160;<br/>human rights violations have been committed in the context of a system of oppression and domination of the&#160;<br/>Palestinian people by the Israeli state for the benefit of Jewish Israelis with the intention of maintaining that&#160;<br/>regime. By their very nature, such discriminatory, segregationist laws, policies and practices are systematic.&#160;<br/>Further, the attack is widespread because the crimes have been committed in a way that is “massive,&#160;<br/>frequent, [and] carried out collectively with considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of&#160;<br/>victims”.1528&#160;The attack against the Palestinian population is therefore both widespread and systematic.<br/>
Considering among other things the legally mandated nature of many of these inhuman and inhumane acts&#160;<br/>and the failure of Israeli courts to provide remedies or to end these violations, the only logical inference is&#160;<br/>that these violations have been committed as part of an attack directed at the civilian population “pursuant&#160;<br/>to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack”.1529&#160;The nature of the&#160;<br/>proscribed acts documented in this chapter make it clear that these violations have been “planned, directed&#160;<br/>or organized” by the Israeli authorities and indeed that many of these violations have been committed on&#160;<br/>the basis of and with reference to Israeli laws and official policies, and&#160;thus by their very nature have been&#160;<br/>committed in furtherance of a state policy. The only conclusion, after careful consideration of the factual&#160;<br/>findings, is that they form part of a widespread as well as systematic&#160;attack directed against the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population, and that the crimes committed within the context of this attack constitute crimes against&#160;<br/>humanity as defined in international law.<br/>

<a name=266></a><b>7. CONCLUSIONS AND&#160;</b><br/>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><br/>
<b>7.1 CONCLUSIONS &#160;<br/>7.1.1 A SYSTEM AND CRIME OF APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS<br/></b>This report analyses whether institutionalized discrimination committed in Israel and the OPT and against&#160;<br/>Palestinian refugees amounts to a system of apartheid as well as whether the serious human rights violations&#160;<br/>committed within the context of implementing this system constitutes the crime of apartheid.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has considered whether Israeli laws, policies and practices deployed against&#160;<br/>the Palestinian people violate international human rights law as well as whether they constitute crimes&#160;<br/>under the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. Amnesty International understands apartheid as&#160;<br/>condemned by the ICERD to constitute the creation and maintenance of a system or regime of oppression&#160;<br/>and domination by one racial group over another. The crime of apartheid is committed when inhuman or&#160;<br/>inhumane acts are committed within the context of a widespread or systematic attack directed at a civilian&#160;<br/>population with the intention of creating or maintaining such a system of oppression and domination by one&#160;<br/>racial group over any other racial group or groups.&#160;<br/>
The totality of the regime of laws, policies and practices described in this report demonstrates that Israel&#160;<br/>has established and maintained an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian&#160;<br/>population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis – a system of apartheid –&#160;wherever it has exercised control&#160;<br/>over Palestinians’ lives since 1948. The report concludes that the State of Israel considers and treats&#160;<br/>Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group. The segregation is conducted in a systematic and&#160;<br/>highly institutionalized manner through laws, policies and practices, all of which are intended to prevent&#160;<br/>Palestinians from claiming and enjoying equal rights with Jewish Israelis within the territory of Israel and&#160;<br/>within the OPT, and thus are intended to oppress and dominate the Palestinian people. This has been&#160;<br/>complemented by a legal regime that controls (by negating) the rights of Palestinian refugees residing&#160;<br/>outside Israel and the OPT to return to their homes.&#160;<br/>
Israel has ensured that the Palestinian people are segmented into different geographical areas and treated&#160;<br/>differently with the intention and effect of dividing the population while consistently preventing its members&#160;<br/>from exercising their fundamental human rights. Thus, the legal fragmentation of the Palestinian population&#160;<br/>between Israel, East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the refugee communities&#160;<br/>serves as a foundational element of the regime of oppression and domination of Palestinians. This legal&#160;<br/>fragmentation denies Palestinians the possibility of realizing equality within Israel and the OPT.&#160;<br/>
Other aspects of the system of oppression and domination include legal regimes that ensure the denial&#160;<br/>of nationality and residence, denial of family life, severe restrictions on freedom of movement, and&#160;<br/>

<a name=267></a>discriminatory seizure and allocation of and access to resources. All of these have enabled and resulted in&#160;<br/>grave violations of social and economic rights, including access to housing, adequate standards of living,&#160;<br/>livelihoods, work, healthcare, food security, water and sanitation, and education. The outcome of these legal&#160;<br/>regimes has been the prolonged and cruel violation of the human rights of individual Palestinians wherever&#160;<br/>Israel exercises control over their enjoyment of these rights.&#160;<br/>
Israel’s system of institutionalized segregation and discrimination against Palestinians, as a racial group, in&#160;<br/>all areas under its control amounts to a system of apartheid, and a serious violation of Israel’s human rights&#160;<br/>obligations. Almost all of Israel’s civilian administration and military authorities, as well as governmental&#160;<br/>and quasi-governmental institutions, are involved in the enforcement of a system of apartheid against&#160;<br/>Palestinians across Israel and the OPT and against Palestinian refugees and their descendants outside the&#160;<br/>territory. The intention to maintain this system has been explicitly declared by successive Israeli political&#160;<br/>leaders, emphasizing the overarching objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli domination by excluding,&#160;<br/>segregating and expelling Palestinians. The intention was clearly crystallized in the 2018 nation state law,&#160;<br/>which constitutionally enshrined racial discrimination against non-Jewish people in Israel and the OPT.&#160;<br/>Senior civilian and military officials have also issued numerous public&#160;statements and directives over the&#160;<br/>years that reveal, maintain and enforce the institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination&#160;<br/>of Palestinians, being fully aware of, and therefore fully responsible for, the atrocious consequences the&#160;<br/>regime has for the lives of the Palestinian population.&#160;<br/>
Israel continues to perpetrate widespread as well as systematic human rights violations against the&#160;<br/>Palestinian population against a backdrop of decades of state-sponsored discrimination, segregation and&#160;<br/>persecution that has targeted the Palestinian population as a whole on the basis of their non-Jewish identity&#160;<br/>and national status. This report documents inhuman and inhumane acts, serious human rights violations&#160;<br/>and crimes under international law, committed against the Palestinian population with the intent to maintain&#160;<br/>this system of oppression and domination.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has examined specifically the inhumane acts&#160;of forcible transfer, administrative&#160;<br/>detention and torture, unlawful killings and serious injuries, and the denial of basic freedoms or persecution&#160;<br/>committed against the Palestinian population in Israel and the OPT. The organization has concluded that&#160;<br/>the patterns of proscribed acts perpetrated by Israel form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack&#160;<br/>directed against the Palestinian population, and that the inhuman or inhumane acts committed within the&#160;<br/>context of this attack have been committed with the intention to maintain this system and amount to the&#160;<br/>crime against humanity of apartheid under both the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute.&#160;<br/>
<b>7.1.2 LEGAL REMEDIES<br/></b>Legal remedies exist, including at the international level, to address, at least in part, the system and crime of&#160;<br/>apartheid perpetuated by Israel against Palestinians.<br/>
The State of Palestine is pursuing one through the UN human rights system. On 23 April 2018, the&#160;<br/>State of Palestine submitted against Israel one of the first interstate communications to CERD.1530&#160;The&#160;<br/>communication was deposited pursuant to Article 11(1) of the ICERD, which provides the following:&#160;<br/>
<i>If a State Party considers that another State Party is not giving effect to the provisions of this&#160;<br/>Convention, it may bring the matter to the attention of the Committee. The Committee shall then&#160;<br/>transmit the communication to the State Party concerned. Within three months, the receiving State&#160;<br/>shall submit to the Committee written explanations or statements clarifying the matter and the remedy,&#160;<br/>if any, that may have been taken by that State.1531&#160;&#160;</i><br/>

<hr/>
<a name=268></a>The State of Palestine’s interstate communication provided that Israel “has violated articles 2, 3 and 5 of&#160;<br/>the Convention with regard to Palestinian citizens living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem.”1532<br/>
The claim is based on the fact that the prohibition of apartheid, as a system of institutionalized&#160;<br/>discrimination, entails an obligation on the State of Israel to “condemn racial segregation and apartheid&#160;<br/>and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their&#160;<br/>jurisdiction”.1533&#160;CERD has concluded that Israel has violated Article 3 of the ICERD, although it did not&#160;<br/>explicitly used the term “apartheid” in reaching these conclusions, and called on Israel to eradicate all such&#160;<br/>policies and practices against non-Jewish communities and in particular “policies or practices that severely&#160;<br/>and disproportionately affect the Palestinian population” in Israel and the OPT.1534&#160;&#160;<br/>
Following responses and further statements by both the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, CERD&#160;<br/>decided on 12 December 2019 that it had jurisdiction to deal with the interstate communication submitted&#160;<br/>by the State of Palestine.1535&#160;On 30 April 2021, it rendered the interstate communication by the State of&#160;<br/>Palestine admissible,1536&#160;and requested its chair, in accordance with Article 12(1) of the ICERD, to move the&#160;<br/>communication to an ad hoc conciliation commission.1537&#160;<br/>
Another remedy involves investigations and prosecutions, since the crime against humanity of apartheid&#160;<br/>entails individual international criminal responsibility,1538&#160;which applies to individuals, members of&#160;<br/>organizations and representatives of the state who commit and participate in the commission of the crime&#160;<br/>of apartheid.1539&#160;Thus, all those with jurisdiction over the commission of the crime against humanity of&#160;<br/>apartheid, including Israel itself, the Palestinian authorities, the international community and the ICC,&#160;<br/>can and should investigate the commission of these crimes. Where there is reasonable suspicion that&#160;<br/>individuals bear individual criminal responsibility for the commission of these crimes, they can and should&#160;<br/>ensure their prosecution.&#160;<br/>
States may exercise universal jurisdiction over all persons reasonably suspected of committing the crime&#160;<br/>under international law of apartheid.1540&#160;Articles IV and V of the Apartheid Convention, read together,&#160;<br/>create an obligation on states parties to exercise universal jurisdiction over the crime against humanity of&#160;<br/>

<a name=269></a>apartheid.1541&#160;The International Law Commission’s 2019 Draft articles on Prevention and Punishment of&#160;<br/>Crimes Against Humanity provide that “the State in the territory under whose jurisdiction the alleged offender&#160;<br/>is present shall, if it does not extradite or surrender the person to another State or competent international&#160;<br/>criminal court or tribunal, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.”1542&#160;<br/>
The obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction on states parties to the Apartheid Convention includes the&#160;<br/>obligation to prosecute non-nationals for the crime of apartheid committed in the territory of a non-state&#160;<br/>party, where the accused is within the jurisdiction of a state party.1543&#160;States parties are obliged to prosecute,&#160;<br/>bring to trial and punish those persons responsible for the crime of apartheid, which means that states must&#160;<br/>conduct prompt, effective and impartial criminal investigations when presented with reasonable evidence&#160;<br/>that an individual within their territory or control is reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility.&#160;<br/>
The Apartheid Convention also provides that states parties to the convention are obliged “to grant extradition&#160;<br/>in accordance with their legislation and with the treaties in force.”1544&#160;This provision amounts to a duty&#160;<br/>on states parties to extradite persons where this is sought for the purposes of prosecution for the crime&#160;<br/>under international law of apartheid. Coupled with the obligation of states parties in Articles IV and V, the&#160;<br/>convention creates the legal obligation on states under public international law to prosecute persons who&#160;<br/>commit serious international crimes where no other state has requested extradition (<i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>&#160;<br/>obligations) on states parties to the convention.1545&#160;<br/>
States parties to the Rome Statute have affirmed “that the most&#160;serious crimes of concern to the international&#160;<br/>community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking&#160;<br/>measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation”. The Rome Statute also provides&#160;<br/>“that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international&#160;<br/>crimes”. In light of these provisions, states parties to the Rome Statute should ensure that they investigate and&#160;<br/>prosecute perpetrators of the crime against humanity of apartheid in line with their Rome Statute undertakings.&#160;<br/>
The State of Palestine became a state party to the Rome Statute on 2 January 2015 and has accepted the&#160;<br/>jurisdiction of the ICC over alleged crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, committed in&#160;<br/>the “occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.” On 16 January 2015,&#160;<br/>the ICC Prosecutor announced the opening of a preliminary examination into the “Situation in Palestine”&#160;<br/>

overwhelmingly supported by the preparatory work of the Convention.” See also, for example, Amnesty International,&#160;<i>Universal Jurisdiction:&#160;</i><br/>

a non-State party. Moreover, to the extent that the term&#160;<i>apartheid</i>&#160;is given a generic definition applicable to practices of States… it must be&#160;<br/>
presumed that no State indulging in such practices would also be a State party to the Apartheid Convention. Accordingly, the&#160;distinctive&#160;<br/>
essence of the Apartheid Convention is that it addresses the consequences for States generally of conduct occurring within another&#160;<br/>
State… This distinctiveness is of central importance to the question of implementation, for unlike other related instruments the&#160;<i>Apartheid</i>&#160;<br/>
Convention cannot and does not rely on cooperation of the State wherein the reported human rights violation has occurred. On the contrary,&#160;<br/>
it concerns itself with co-operation of States within which no such violations have occurred.”<br/>

article II of the&#160;<i>Apartheid</i>&#160;Convention includes&#160;<i>inter alia</i>&#160;conduct deemed a ‘crime under international law’ and conduct regarding which&#160;<br/>
an international duty to prosecute or extradite exists [under the convention]… the conduct in question should be criminalized under the&#160;<br/>
national criminal law of the signatory States and thus embody the maxim&#160;<i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>”. In relation to the “international penal&#160;<br/>
tribunal” mentioned in the Apartheid Convention, although consideration was given in 1980 to the establishment of a special international&#160;<br/>
criminal court to try persons specifically for the crime of apartheid (see UN Doc. E/CN.4/1426, 19 January 1981), no such court has yet&#160;<br/>
been established. However, it has been held that (in relation to Article VI of the Genocide Convention) that “there can be no doubt that the&#160;<br/>

crime of apartheid.<br/>

<a name=270></a>in order to establish whether the Rome Statute criteria into opening an ICC investigation are met, as per&#160;<br/>the court’s procedures. On 15 May 2018, the State of Palestine made a referral pursuant to Articles 13(a)&#160;<br/>and 14 of the Rome Statute. The referral requested the Prosecutor “to investigate, in accordance with the&#160;<br/>temporal jurisdiction of the Court, past, ongoing and future crimes within the court’s jurisdiction, committed&#160;<br/>in all parts of the territory of the State of Palestine”.1546&#160;On 20 December 2019, the ICC Prosecutor&#160;<br/>concluded that “all the statutory criteria under the Rome Statute for&#160;the opening of an investigation… into&#160;<br/>the situation in Palestine” had been met, but requested a ruling from the Pre-Trial Chamber on “the scope of&#160;<br/>the territorial jurisdiction” of the ICC in Palestine.1546&#160;On 5 February 2021, the Pre-Trial Chamber concluded&#160;<br/>that the ICC finds that the “Court’s territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine extends to the territories&#160;<br/>occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem”,1548&#160;opening&#160;<br/>the way for investigation into crimes committed in the OPT since 13 June 2014. On 3 March 2021, the&#160;<br/>Prosecutor announced that her office was proceeding to open an investigation into Rome Statute crimes&#160;<br/>committed in the OPT.1549<br/>
While the ICC has held that it has jurisdiction over Rome Statute crimes committed in the OPT, it does&#160;<br/>not have jurisdiction over crimes committed within Israel itself. However, the UN Security Council has the&#160;<br/>power to refer to the ICC situations where it appears that one or more of the Rome Statute crimes have been&#160;<br/>committed, which would include the crime against humanity of apartheid (as defined in the Rome Statute),&#160;<br/>regardless of whether or not the state in question is a state party to the Rome Statute.1550<br/>
The right to truth entails an obligation on Israel to promptly, impartially and effectively investigate human&#160;<br/>rights violations and to ensure that the truth of apartheid and violations of human rights are publicized.1551&#160;<br/>The right to justice requires a remedy against human rights violations, and obliges Israel and the&#160;<br/>international community to combat impunity and to bring perpetrators to justice through fair trials.1552<br/>
Finally, the right to reparation entails a right of victims to full, prompt and effective compensation, restitution,&#160;<br/>rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.1553&#160;While “reparation” is often equated with&#160;<br/>compensation or the provision of certain compensatory benefits in response to wrongdoing, procedural&#160;<br/>rights to an investigation, to truth and to justice are equally central to reparation.1554&#160;The right to reparation of&#160;<br/>

<b>ISRAEL’S APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/></b>CRUEL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION AND CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY &#160;&#160;<br/>

Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=271></a>violations of international law obligations is recognized in customary international law. The right of individuals&#160;<br/>to effective remedy and reparation for violations of their human rights is found in many international&#160;<br/>treaties1555&#160;and other international law instruments.1556<br/>
The UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross&#160;<br/>Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law&#160;<br/>“provide a timely and useful tool for the implementation of victims’ rights at national level, as well as a&#160;<br/>benchmark for international bodies such as the International Criminal Court.”1557&#160;They also provide that,&#160;<br/>in accordance with domestic law and international law, victims should be provided with full and effective&#160;<br/>reparation, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.1558&#160;<br/>
While Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute, any international criminal process that may pursue individual&#160;<br/>criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of apartheid should similarly provide for reparations&#160;<br/>to victims, as provided in Article 75 of the Rome Statute. Reparations within an international criminal law&#160;<br/>process should oblige those responsible for serious crimes to repair the harm they caused to victims and&#160;<br/>enable justice proceedings to ensure that offenders account for their acts. They should also – to the extent&#160;<br/>achievable – relieve the suffering caused by crimes under international law; afford justice to victims by&#160;<br/>alleviating the consequences of the wrongful acts; and deter future violations.1559<br/>
<b>7.1.3 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY INACTION&#160;<br/></b>Despite the legal remedies that exist and the other action that could have been taken, for over seven&#160;<br/>decades, the international community has stood by as Israel has been given free rein to dispossess,&#160;<br/>segregate, control, oppress and dominate Palestinians. The numerous UN Security Council resolutions&#160;<br/>adopted over the years have remained unimplemented with Israel facing no repercussions for actions that&#160;<br/>have violated international law apart from formulaic condemnations.&#160;<br/>
Without taking any meaningful action to hold Israel to account for its systematic and widespread violations&#160;<br/>and crimes under international law against the Palestinian population, the international community has&#160;<br/>contributed to undermining the international legal order and has emboldened Israel to continue perpetrating&#160;<br/>crimes with impunity. In fact, some states have actively supported Israel’s violations by supplying it with&#160;<br/>arms, equipment and other tools to perpetrate crimes under international law and by providing diplomatic&#160;<br/>cover, including at the UN Security Council, to shield it from accountability. By doing so, they have&#160;<br/>completely failed the Palestinian people and have only exacerbated Palestinians’ lived experience as people&#160;<br/>with lesser rights and inferior status to Jewish Israelis.<br/>
Meanwhile, addressing Israeli violations against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip&#160;<br/>merely within the framework of international humanitarian law, and separately from the violations perpetrated&#160;<br/>against Palestinians in Israel, has failed to tackle the root causes of&#160;the conflict and achieve any form of&#160;<br/>accountability and justice for the victims.<br/>
1555.&#160;See, for example, Rome Statute, Article 75; Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 8; ICCPR, Articles 2(3), 9(5) and&#160;14(6);&#160;<br/>

<a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/7_7_2019.pdf">articles/7_7_2019.pdf&#160;Within the Rome Statute, reparations are awarded against a convicted person in the form of restitution, compensation&#160;</a><br/>
and rehabilitation, and they may be ordered on an individual basis, collectively (for example to communities affected), or both (ICC Rules&#160;<br/>
of Procedure and Evidence, Rule 97). While reparations in the form of satisfaction are not provided for in the Rome Statute, the ICC has&#160;<br/>
ordered “symbolic” measures and reparations awards. See&#160;<i>Prosecutor v. Lubanga</i>, Case ICC-01/04-01/06, judgment, 7 August 2012,&#160;<br/>
para. 222. Although Article 75 of the Rome Statute lists restitution, compensation and rehabilitation as forms of reparations,&#160;this list is not&#160;<br/>
exclusive. Other types of reparations, for instance those with a symbolic, preventative or transformative value, may also be appropriate, as&#160;<br/>
well as publishing an apology made by a convicted person.&#160;<br/>

271<br/>
Amnesty International<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=272></a><b>7.2 RECOMMENDATIONS &#160;<br/></b>Given these conclusions, Amnesty International is providing the following wide-ranging recommendations&#160;<br/>to the Israeli authorities and other relevant stakeholders to dismantle the system of apartheid against&#160;<br/>Palestinians and end the associated human rights violations.&#160;<br/>
It is making recommendations to the Israeli authorities covering laws, practices and policies that relate to&#160;<br/>Palestinians in general, as well as specific ones relating to each of the&#160;domains of control – Israel, East&#160;<br/>Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip – and Palestinian refugees outside Israel and the&#160;<br/>OPT. It also has a few recommendations for the Palestinian authorities.<br/>
In addition, given the scale and seriousness of the violations documented in this report, it is calling on the&#160;<br/>international community to urgently and drastically change its approach&#160;to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and&#160;<br/>recognize the full extent of the crimes that Israel perpetrates against the Palestinian people. Based on this,&#160;<br/>it is making recommendations to UN bodies, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC, other governments and&#160;<br/>regional actors, businesses and national and international humanitarian and development organizations.<br/>
The UN, in particular, must take all steps to reasonably ensure the rights of Palestinians violated by the&#160;<br/>system of apartheid established in Israel and the OPT. To do this they must put pressure on the government&#160;<br/>of Israel to dismantle the system of oppression and domination and ensure individual remedies and&#160;<br/>reparations to all those whose rights have been violated.&#160;<br/>
Dismantling this appalling system of apartheid is essential for the millions of Palestinians who continue to live&#160;<br/>in Israel and the OPT, as well as for the return of Palestinian refugees who continue to be displaced in the&#160;<br/>region, so that they can enjoy their basic human rights free from discrimination.&#160;<br/>
<b>7.2.1 ISRAELI AUTHORITIES<br/></b>•&#160;<br/>
End the system of apartheid by dismantling measures of discrimination, segregation and oppression&#160;<br/>currently in place against the Palestinian population and undertake a review of all laws, regulations,&#160;<br/>policies and practices that discriminate on racial, ethnic or religious grounds, and repeal or amend&#160;<br/>them to bring them into line with international human rights law and standards, in particular Israel’s&#160;<br/>obligations to ensure the principle of non-discrimination under international law.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Grant equal and full human rights to all Palestinians in Israel and the OPT in line with principles of&#160;<br/>international human rights law and without discrimination, while ensuring respect for protections&#160;<br/>guaranteed for Palestinians in the OPT under international humanitarian law.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Immediately order members of all state authorities to end and refrain from all future conduct that&#160;<br/>violates international law, including forcible transfer of population, arbitrary arrest, administrative&#160;<br/>detention, torture and other ill-treatment, unlawful killings and infliction of injuries, as well as restrictions&#160;<br/>on other fundamental rights, such as arbitrarily restricting Palestinians’ freedom of movement and&#160;<br/>residence in their communities, their right to family life, and their rights to access livelihoods, housing,&#160;<br/>food, water, essential healthcare services and education.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Suspend from active duty any military or official personnel suspected of ordering or committing grave&#160;<br/>violations of international law pending the completion of investigations.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Develop clear guidelines requiring law enforcement officials to report&#160;abuses, and ensure that officers at&#160;<br/>all levels of the chain of command know about these guidelines and are held responsible for enforcing&#160;<br/>them, with penalties imposed, following fair proceedings, for failing to report, or covering up, violations&#160;<br/>or misconduct by security forces.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Order prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigations into all allegations of crimes against&#160;<br/>humanity and other serious human rights violations by state officials&#160;and actors. Where there is&#160;<br/>sufficient admissible evidence, bring those reasonably suspected of&#160;individual criminal responsibility,&#160;<br/>including command responsibility, to trial in proceedings that meet international standards of fairness.<br/>

•&#160;<br/>
Provide victims of human rights violations, crimes against humanity and serious violations of&#160;<br/>international humanitarian law – and their families – with full reparations. These should include&#160;<br/>restitution of and compensation for all properties acquired on a racial basis, including restitution of and&#160;<br/>compensation for properties confiscated by the Custodian of Absentee&#160;Property.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Accede to the Apartheid Convention and to the Rome Statute; issue a declaration accepting the ICC’s&#160;<br/>jurisdiction since 1 July 2002; and incorporate the provisions of these treaties into domestic law.&#160;<br/>
<b>SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO ISRAEL<br/></b>•&#160;<br/>

•&#160;<br/>
Introduce specific safeguards to ensure that no individual is arbitrarily&#160;deprived of their citizenship,&#160;<br/>including by amending the 1952 Nationality Law.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
End policies that prevent Palestinians’ family unification, refrain from&#160;pursuing the enactment of a&#160;<br/>new version of the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law in force from 2003 to 2021 and ensure that&#160;<br/>processing family unification applications for spouses and children of Israeli citizens and Palestinian&#160;<br/>residents of Jerusalem and of the OPT is done according to the principle of non-discrimination,&#160;<br/>examining each case on an individual basis and on its merit.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Ensure an end to discrimination in the exercise of the right of all people to participate in public&#160;<br/>life, including by voting and standing for election. In particular, take effective steps to increase the&#160;<br/>representation and participation of minorities in decision-making processes, and refrain for disqualifying&#160;<br/>them on discriminatory grounds such as political opinion.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Revoke discriminatory policies that allow for discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel based&#160;<br/>on military service in accessing social and economic benefits or certain&#160;forms of work in Israel.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Provide adequate provisions to ensure non-discrimination, transparency and accountability in terms of&#160;<br/>distribution and use of state land in Israel, and reform the role and/or scope of responsibilities of quasi-<br/>state Jewish institutions in order to achieve this end.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Ensure adequate remedies, including just compensation and restitution, for all those whose land was&#160;<br/>illegally expropriated as state land.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Repeal or amend discriminatory laws and policies governing the zoning and allocation of land in Israel&#160;<br/>and ensure that such laws and policies are implemented in a manner that respects the prohibition of&#160;<br/>discrimination on grounds including race, religion, national or ethnic origin and descent.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Cancel all outstanding orders for evictions and demolitions and introduce a moratorium on future&#160;<br/>evictions and demolitions until the law is amended in a manner that complies with international&#160;<br/>standards and thereby ensures Palestinians are not subjected to forced evictions.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Immediately grant legal recognition and status to the unrecognized villages in the Negev/Naqab. Legal&#160;<br/>security of tenure should be afforded to the residents of these villages. Sustainable access to safe,&#160;<br/>potable drinking water, electricity, sanitation, sewage, refuse disposal, emergency services, medical&#160;<br/>care and education must be guaranteed to all residents. Efforts to forcibly remove the inhabitants of&#160;<br/>unrecognized villages should be immediately halted.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Ensure access to effective redress and reparation to those who have had their homes demolished as a&#160;<br/>result of discriminatory policies.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Ensure that Palestinian citizens of Israel, especially in the Negev/Naqab, have equitable access to land,&#160;<br/>

Recognize the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to homes where they or their&#160;<br/>families once lived in Israel or the OPT, and to receive restitution and compensation and other effective&#160;<br/>remedies for the loss of their land and property.<br/>
<b>7.2.2 PALESTINIAN AUTHORITIES<br/></b>•&#160;<br/>
Document as necessary and in line with international standards the discriminatory impact of Israel’s&#160;<br/>system of apartheid against the Palestinian population in the OPT to provide evidence of such impact to&#160;<br/>relevant international courts and other bodies.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Ensure that operations and any type of dealings with Israel, primarily through security coordination, do&#160;<br/>not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid against Palestinians in the OPT.&#160;<br/>
<b>7.2.3 UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL<br/></b>As a council and through the mandates it creates:<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Assess whether the denial of nationality, restrictions on movement, freedom of assembly, association&#160;<br/>and religion, participation in public life, and access to healthcare, education, livelihoods, housing,&#160;<br/>employment, food security, and water and sanitation, constitute crimes under international law, in&#160;<br/>particular the crime against humanity of apartheid.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Provide recommendations and assistance designed to dismantle these and other systems of oppression&#160;<br/>and domination.<br/>
<b>7.2.4 UN SECURITY COUNCIL<br/></b>•&#160;<br/>
Impose targeted sanctions, such as asset freezes, against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of&#160;<br/>apartheid.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel. The embargo should cover the direct and indirect&#160;<br/>supply, sale or transfer, including transit and trans-shipment of all weapons, munitions and other military&#160;<br/>and security equipment, including the provision of training and other military and security assistance.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Explore avenues to bring perpetrators of crimes under international law to justice, in particular if Israel&#160;<br/>itself fails to investigate and prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and other human&#160;<br/>rights violations perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Israel and the OPT. This could include&#160;<br/>referring the entire situation to the ICC or establishing an international tribunal to try alleged perpetrators of&#160;<br/>international crimes.&#160;<br/>
<b>7.2.5 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY<br/></b>•&#160;<br/>
Re-establish the Special Committee against Apartheid, which was originally established under UN&#160;<br/>General Assembly Resolution 1761 (XVII) of 6 November 1962, to focus on all situations, including&#160;<br/>

<a name=277></a>Israel and the OPT, where the serious human rights violation and crime against humanity of apartheid&#160;<br/>are being committed and to bring pressure on those responsible to disestablish these systems of&#160;<br/>oppression and domination.<br/>
<b>7.2.6 OFFICE OF PROSECUTOR OF ICC&#160;<br/></b>•&#160;<br/>
Consider the applicability of the crime against humanity of apartheid within the current formal&#160;<br/>investigation of crimes under international law committed in the OPT since 13 June 2014.<br/>
<b>7.2.7 OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND REGIONAL ACTORS<br/></b>(in particular those that enjoy close diplomatic relations with Israel such as the USA, the European Union&#160;<br/>and its member states and the UK, as well as those that are in the process of strengthening their ties, such&#160;<br/>as some Arab and Africa states)<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Do not support the system of apartheid or render aid or assistance to maintaining such a regime, and&#160;<br/>cooperate to bring an end to this unlawful situation.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
&#160;Immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, including transit and trans-<br/>shipment to Israel of all weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the&#160;<br/>provision of training and other military and security assistance.<br/>

Institute and enforce a ban on products from Israeli settlements in your markets and regulate&#160;<br/>companies domiciled in your jurisdiction in a manner to prohibit companies’ operation in settlements or&#160;<br/>trade in settlements goods.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Exercise universal jurisdiction in investigating any person under your jurisdiction who may reasonably&#160;<br/>be suspected of committing crimes against humanity or other crimes under international law. Ensure&#160;<br/>that all proceedings meet international standards of fairness and do not involve seeking or imposing&#160;<br/>the death penalty. There should be no time limit for prosecuting crimes against humanity, nor should&#160;<br/>immunity from prosecution or amnesties be granted for such crimes.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Ensure that your legal and institutional frameworks enable the effective investigation and prosecution of&#160;<br/>perpetrators of the crime against humanity of apartheid.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Use all political and diplomatic tools at your disposal to ensure Israeli authorities implement the&#160;<br/>recommendations outlined in this report and ensure that human rights are central to all bilateral and&#160;<br/>multilateral agreements with the Israeli authorities, including by exercising due diligence to ensure that&#160;<br/>these do not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid.<br/>
•&#160;<br/>
Publicly recognize that international crimes, including the crime of apartheid, are being committed in&#160;<br/>Israel and the OPT.&#160;<br/>

CRUEL&#160;SYSTEM&#160;OF&#160;DOMINATION&#160;AND&#160;CRIME&#160;AGAINST&#160;HUMANITY<br/>
Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued a policy of&#160;<br/>establishing&#160;and&#160;maintaining&#160;a&#160;Jewish&#160;demographic&#160;hegemony&#160;<br/>and maximizing its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis while&#160;<br/>restricting&#160;the&#160;rights&#160;of&#160;Palestinians&#160;and&#160;preventing&#160;Palestinian&#160;<br/>refugees from returning to their homes. In 1967, Israel extended&#160;<br/>this policy to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it has occupied&#160;<br/>ever&#160;since.&#160;<br/>
Amnesty International has analysed Israel’s intent to create and&#160;<br/>maintain a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians&#160;<br/>and examined its key components: territorial fragmentation;&#160;<br/>segregation and control; dispossession of land and property; and&#160;<br/>denial of economic and social rights. It has concluded that this&#160;<br/>system amounts to apartheid. It has also documented unlawful&#160;<br/>acts committed by Israel against Palestinians with the intent to&#160;<br/>maintain&#160;this&#160;system,&#160;including&#160;forcible&#160;transfers,&#160;administrative&#160;<br/>detention and torture, unlawful kil&#160;ings, denial of basic rights and&#160;<br/>freedoms and persecution. It has concluded that such acts form&#160;<br/>part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against&#160;<br/>the Palestinian population and amount to the crime against&#160;<br/>humanity&#160;of&#160;apartheid.&#160;<br/>
Israel must dismantle this cruel system and the international&#160;<br/>community must pressure it to do so. All those with jurisdiction&#160;<br/>over the crimes committed to maintain the system should&#160;<br/>investigate&#160;them.&#160;<br/>
